         "title":"Legal recourse? Nissan balances competitive and security fallout from source code leak",
         "Prediction_result":1,
         "content":"News that source code of Nissan North America tools leaked online because of a misconfigured Git server spurs questions not only about potential cyberattacks by bad actors, but also whether competitors could use the sensitive data against the automobile giant.\n\nNissan offerings associated with the leaked source code ran the gamut from Nissan North America mobile apps and Nissan\u2019s internal core mobile library to some parts of the Nissan ASIST diagnostic tool and sales and marketing research tools and data. The Git server has since been taken offline, after data began to get shared on Telegram and hacking forums.\n\nBased on discussions with intellectual property lawyers, Nissan may have some recourse in terms of filing injunctions and suing for damages under copyright, trade secrets and patent laws. To do so, the auto maker will have to expend a great deal of resources to track violators down and bring them to court. This assumes that the violators are in the United States and the company could take action under U.S. law.\n\nThomas Moga, a senior counsel and intellectual property attorney at Dykema, which has many automotive clients, said that according to the U.S. Copyright Office, laws protect original works of authorship \u201cfixed in a tangible medium of expression.\u201d Moga added that under that definition, source code can qualify for protection under the copyright laws.\n\n\u201cSo it appears that Nissan owns a copyright in the source code and that it may well be in a position to bring an action against unauthorized users of its source code,\u201d Moga said. \u201cBut it\u2019s up to Nissan to pursue those actions; I think we can expect them to be very aggressive, as they should be.\u201d\n\nJennifer DeTrani, general counsel and executive vice president of Nisos, added that Nissan could potentially file lawsuits as part of a legal strategy to repair the reputational damage from the leak, showing the public they are serious about protecting their vehicles. But legal remedies would not yield much.\n\n\u201cCollecting damages under copyright law assumes that there\u2019s somebody with deep pockets to sue who would pay,\u201d DeTrani said. \u201cAny competent lawyer could get the case thrown out by pointing out to the court that the company did not adequately protect those secrets,\u201d considering that the company kept the default username and password of admin/admin. And \u201cwhile patented, and therefore protectable material may exist within the code library, they would have to prove that a competitor infringed on their patent to use this approach.\u201d\n\nDeTrani added that it\u2019s mostly on Nissan to close the gaping hole in their security posture, rewrite and start over. She said once source code has been openly shared, that typically leaves a company with very few options. Nissan could also pursue lawsuits with the platforms where the code gets shared and try to get it taken down, but that won\u2019t be very successful, said DeTrani.\n\n\u201cThe platform companies are often served with notices that they are violating proprietary rights,\u201d DeTrani said. \u201cIt becomes very hard to adjudicate those rights within platforms even though terms and conditions may technically protect a rights holder.\u201d If Nissan, for example, asserted that their copyright is being infringed, many copyrights are unregistered and a platform would require a court order to get involved. Even then, platform companies are inundated with requests. Maybe more noteworthy, DeTrani said, \u201cthe harm is already done, because the code has been pulled down into private libraries that hackers maintain separately from the platforms in which the code may initially appear.\u201d\n\nThe view from the security pros\n\nNews of the breach went public when Tillie Kottmann, the Swiss-based software engineer who learned of the leak from an anonymous source, shared her analysis with ZDNet, which reported that Nissan confirmed it had conducted an investigation regarding improper access to proprietary company source code.\n\nNissan said that it takes the matter seriously and they are confident that no personal data from consumers, dealers or employees was accessible in this security incident. The auto maker said the affected system has been secured and they are \u201cconfident that there\u2019s no information in the exposed source code that would put consumers or their vehicles at risk.\u201d\n\nJustin Zeefe, co-founder and president of Nisos, said he was less concerned about one of Nissan\u2019s competitors getting ahold of the source code compared with potential damage from a malicious hacker.\n\n\u201cI think there will be people who look for ways to monetize this breach,\u201d Zeefe said. \u201cA malicious hacker who wants to demonstrate their capacity could potentially find within the code a way to manipulate the software to cause physical damage to the car and potentially the occupants. I can\u2019t speak to the specific plausibility in this case, but as physical and digital continue to merge, loss of intellectual property can do more than damage reputation.\u201d\n\nStephen Banda, senior manager, security solutions at Lookout, said while security teams should always prioritize preventing unauthorized system access and data leakage, it becomes especially important when leaked data can jeopardize customer privacy as well as physical safety.\n\n\u201cToday, anyone with a newer vehicle may be using a mobile app to perform a number of functions, such as starting the engine, locking/unlocking doors, setting a daily remote start schedule, or storing trip history,\u201d Banda said. \u201cHowever, as shown by the Nissan data leak, any time we use mobile apps in general, we need to understand the potential risk tradeoff we make for the convenience that these apps offer.\u201d\n\nBy leaking source code to its mobile vehicle app as well as its internal core mobile library, Nissan has provided hackers with a roadmap for developing malicious apps and malware targeting users, Banda said. This could let cyber criminals gain access to driver information and usage patterns as well as potentially enable control of core vehicle functions, such as locking/unlocking doors, presenting a risk of vehicle theft as well as a risk to driver safety.\n\n\u201cCybercriminals are also likely to leverage phishing attacks posing to be from Nissan to deposit malware or obtain credentials,\u201d Banda said. \u201cUsers should make sure they verify the sender information before responding to any messages.\u201d\n\nLaurence Pitt, global security strategy director at Juniper Networks, said that other auto makers have had data stolen via a Git server misconfiguration. Mercedes suffered the same embarrassment when a source-code breach for smart-car components leaked data in May 2020.\n\nBut where is the real value?\n\n\u201cThe data is valuable in that buyers and downloaders of this data will use it to reverse-engineer code, look for weak-spots in web-portals and find ways to hack into consoles, either to gain competitive advantages or for darker, more damaging reasons,\u201d Pitt said. \u201cIn both the Nissan and Mercedes cases, the data was left exposed on an unsecured internet-facing server \u2013 a simple Google dork search will find them. We need to remember that Google indexes anything it can see and validate, and so unencrypted, non-passworded data is fair game.\u201d\n\nPitt said organizations handling source code need to take a proactive approach to their security to prevent this from happening. Consider the following as foundational security that should be checked, and run, continuously across any business:",

I\u2019m done with the stupid seasonal time change and done with all of the turmoil it induces in our biological systems, including increased automobile accidents, increased heart attacks, and increased suicides. It is time that we, gardeners and farmers, lead a revolt. There was never a proven worthwhile reason for kicking the clocks back and there are plenty of bad ones. We should bow to the evidence of unintended consequences and stop this nonsense. Consider this our Declaration of Temporal Independence and join me!\n\nI could, in an attempt to wax eloquent, blatantly plagiarize and slightly modify the lead of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams to stir the blood of others to my movement. To wit, \u201cWhen in the course of human events it becomes necessary for Professor Roush to dissolve the political bonds which have forced him to disconnect himself from the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature entitle him, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that he should declare the causes that impel him to the separation.\u201d Well, here it comes.\n\nLike many of you, since the clocks were turned back on November 1st, I\u2019ve been waking aimlessly an hour before I actually need to prepare for work and struggling uselessly to keep my eyes open after 7:00 p.m. I leave home in the dark, and return home in the dark, believing not in the least that I\u2019m somehow contributing to the salvation of humanity by conserving any energy or resources. For weeks, the sun has directly scorched my eyes on my morning commute, while endangering those on the road near my thundering carriage. Now, I barely glimpse the dawn as I transit to fluorescent existence. Weekdays, I haven\u2019t seen my garden in the daylight for months. I\u2019ve tried, oh how hard I\u2019ve tried, to reset my cellular clock, pinning my eyelids up in a futile attempt to stay awake past 8:00 p.m., and lounging in bed trying to stay asleep in the mornings. The ticking clock of my existence is too loud, however, too insistent on following the normal patterns of sun and moon and earth to submit to any mere totalitarian decree.\n\nThis illegal and immoral control on our biological clocks is detrimental not just to humans. Think of our pets, our fur children! My dog Bella now wakes at 5:00 a.m., starving for the food that she gets an hour later in the summer, and comes to me each night barely after supper with her \u201cbaby,\u201d the stuffed lamb she carries to bed, demanding that I call it an evening and join her in bed. The sun is down and her day is over. Who among you can resist the sleepy eyes of the creature shown above, her soulful plea to turn off the TV and turn in just as the 6:00 news has begun?\n\nLet us follow Thoreau\u2019s lead and be civilly disobedient; \u201cWhen a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government.\u201d Myself, I\u2019m not waiting any longer for our elected nincompoops to quit quibbling over budgets and battlefields and turn to the important things. When daylight savings time begins again, on March 14, 2021, I\u2019m staying there, permanently, enjoying the longer evenings. When November comes again, I am staying on Professor Roush Savings Time (PRST), saving my sanity, my heart, and possible innocent bystanders. I\u2019m going to continue to enjoy the moments of daylight after work and my bosses will just have to get used to seeing me come in early and leave late afternoon during PRST. Businesses can either adjust to PRST or do without my monetary contributions to their bottom line, probably better for me and likely unnoticed by them. The evidence that I\u2019m standing with the angels here will be the extension of my life and doubtlessly the gratitude of Bella. Who\u2019s with Bella and me? Stop the madness; stop the time change!\n\nJames Roush is a longtime guest Ranter. Visit his blog here.",

         "title":"Answer to a Reader on What We Should Fear",
         "Prediction_result":1,
         "content":"Answer to a Reader on What We Should Fear By David Henderson\n\nI received the following letter last week and the author gave me permission to quote without using his name.\n\nHi Dr. Henderson, My name is X, I\u2019m a fan of your writing, so I wanted to thank you for your work and insight that I\u2019ve been able to enjoy\u2026 I recently read your article \u201cWhat should we fear most and what should we do about it\u201d in the recent Regulation magazine, and while I generally agree with the policy prescriptions for the FDA I was somewhat confused about the discussion around people\u2019s irrational reaction to different threats in life. I\u2019ve also heard other economists discuss irrational threat response behavior and honestly it strikes me as a bit misguided. But I\u2019m also not an economist or an academic so I may be missing something, and I\u2019d be grateful to hear your thoughts on it.. One thing is that isn\u2019t there a categorical mistake being made when comparing something like shark attacks to things like heart disease or cancer? The latter two seem to be more or less results of aging (or long-term behaviors like excessive eating or smoking, for example). In other words, aren\u2019t illnesses or diseases that come with the territory of aging and dying categorically different than something like a shark attack? I feel the same reasoning could be used to tell people not to worry about walking in a bad part of the city because your chances of dying from cancer are higher than getting shot. It seems like a non-sequitur to me. One way is a gruesome and sudden end to (hypothetically) a younger person\u2019s life while the other is something that is more or less accepted by people as a very possible ending to their lives when they are older\u2013illness and death at the end of life are accepted as part of the tragedy of the human condition. This is not to say that I think people should be very worried about shark attacks, just that the statistical probability analysis comparing these events is missing something. The second thing is the uncertainty of some risks as opposed to others. I\u2019d agree with the proposition that we shouldn\u2019t go too far in restricting freedoms in order to prevent terrorism, but comparing it to illness or automobile accidents again seems misguided to me. I think most people would have found it irrational to say, for example after the attack on Pearl Harbor, that people should be more worried about automobile safety and cancer than Japanese acts of war because their likelihood (at that point) of dying in an attack was much lower. People worried about it because there was uncertainty about further attacks, a time sensitivity to stop aggression as early as possible, and the possible defeat of the US in a war.\n\nAm I missing something here? I appreciate your time and any thoughts you may have on this. I look forward to reading more of your writings!\n\nX was referring to this article by Charley Hooper and me.\n\nHere\u2019s my answer.\n\nFirst, thanks for the compliment.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s consider the shark versus heart disease/cancer point. They are different categories, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a category mistake. You\u2019re right that the heart disease and cancer risk come with age whereas the shark attack is pretty much unrelated to age. They do come with the territory, but there\u2019s a lot you can do about the territory. Just as you can avoid the almost infinitesimal risk of being killed by a shark by staying out of the ocean, you can substantially reduce a risk that\u2019s a few orders of magnitude greater by, say, not smoking cigarettes, getting exercise, and eating in moderation. As someone who just turned 70, I don\u2019t passively say, \u201cOh, that risk comes with the territory.\u201d I want to make it to 100 and I\u2019m doing a number of things will help me. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned medications that will help me as I age.\n\nRegarding the point about walking in certain parts of town, if the risk is high enough, then it easily could be the case that you\u2019re more at risk from dying in an hour from walking in that part of town than you are at risk from dying from a heart attack or cancer in an hour. The sensible way to think about risk is per unit time, whether it be an hour, a day, or a year. As I\u2019m sure you noticed in our article, we normalized by having it be risk in a year.\n\nYou said that comparing terrorism to illness or automobile accidents seems misguided, but you didn\u2019t say why. Why do think that?\n\nRe Pearl Harbor you wrote:\n\nI think most people would have found it irrational to say, for example after the attack on Pearl Harbor, that people should be more worried about automobile safety and cancer than Japanese acts of war because their likelihood (at that point) of dying in an attack was much lower. People worried about it because there was uncertainty about further attacks, a time sensitivity to stop aggression as early as possible, and the possible defeat of the US in a war.\n\nYou make a good point. The way to compare risks there is not to see Pearl Harbor as a one-off event but to put it in context. What was the probability of further attacks? What was the chance the United States would have been defeated in war and what would have been the consequences of that?\n\nWhat that basically says is that it makes sense to look at the whole thing, not just a piece. I would give you my views on the war with Japan because they are different from the views of almost everyone else I know, but that would take us too far away from the statistical issues you\u2019ve raised.\n\nI shared the letter with my co-author Charley Hooper, who answered as follows:",

         "title":"Seven technology trends for 2021",
         "Prediction_result":1,
         "content":"Technology has become an intrinsic part of life, more so in the COVID-19 era. We have seen significant growth in consumer-facing technology such as digital payments, telehealth, productivity aids, communication tools, and robotics or AI-driven equipment. Some of these trends are irreversible and will continue to shape the technological developments of the next year. Research of technology trends at PGA Labs indicates seven trends.\n\n1. Cybersecurity: The increased use of technological tools is exposing networks and applications to security vulnerabilities such as privacy intrusion of individual users and security threats to corporations. 2020 already saw a 37 percent increase in cyberattacks (first half of 2020 over H2 of 2019). Heightened cyber threats coupled with higher user awareness for security is going to increase the focus on cybersecurity. Additionally, with more ubiquitous and pervasive connectivity, the need for cybersecurity will expand from enterprises to individuals.\n\nPopulous countries like India have the highest numbers of internet users. It is not a surprise that the US, China, and India are the top three countries with instances of phishing and malware attacks. Cybersecurity issues are not only limited to stealing data or money frauds but also national security. Given its sheer importance, the Government of India is planning to bring a new cybersecurity policy to protect information infrastructure, build capability to prevent and respond to cyber threats.\n\n2. Use of drones and robotics: While drones and robots were already in use in some specific cases like surveillance, videography, etc., the pandemic has accelerated their usage in other aspects of human lives. The pandemic made the world realise the dependence on human interactions, especially in labour and consumer-focused businesses such as retail, restaurants, and manufacturing. Many delivery companies and restaurants in the US and China launched contactless delivery services where goods are picked up and dropped off at a designated location instead of from or into the hands of a person.\n\nThe government of India has also allowed hyperlocal delivery start-ups to start testing Beyond the Visual Line Of Sight (BVLOS) drones for commercial deliveries and the regulatory framework is expected to crystallise soon.\n\n3. Telehealth and Telemedicine: The pandemic led to a surge in teleconsultations not only for COVID related consultations but also for other chronic diseases. During this period, many governments, hospitals, e-pharmacies, and even corporations have adopted telemedicine in their employee wellness strategies.\n\nAn increase in digital penetration and changing patient behaviour will lead to rapid growth in telemedicine. We believe that telehealth will see rapid growth, much like what EdTech has seen in the last two years.\n\n4. Cloud-native technologies will become mainstream: The lockdown and subsequent months saw a shift in the way organisations operate, with many employees working remotely. This required many small and large organisations to adopt technologies associated with remote working and move more workloads to the Cloud. In tandem with growth in cloud-native technologies, services such as communication, cloud sharing, personal productivity tools, and advisory support to pick the right cloud-based solutions are likely to grow as well.\n\n5. Blockchain to play a larger role: While blockchain has been around for years, 2021 can see faster uptake of this technology in sharing and securing data which will be used in improving supply chains, and creating better healthcare outcomes. Scale blockchain implementations are yet to see success in India but increased digitisation and deeper penetration of Fintech will make the environment more conducive for blockchain to be adopted in simpler supply chains.\n\n6. Internet of Voice: Voice search is here to stay. The global market for hearable devices is expected to exceed $40 billion. The Indian market has seen enormous growth in voice searches in terms of seeking out automobile specifications or aligning in-home security features. A combination of computer vision, vernacular speech recognition, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will shift the focus away from text to voice and video.\n\n7. 5G technology rollout: Many countries such as South Korea and China are already in mature stages of building and deploying 5G technology. India will not be far behind especially as the number of internet users has swelled and data consumption has become akin to the need to consume electricity. 5G technology will provide high speed and reliable mobile internet. 5G is the first wireless technology designed primarily to support mobility services for machines and will eventually be used to connect with machines and pave the way for the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nThe Indian government is likely to auction 5G spectrum over the next six months. To improve access to 5G, policy initiatives must ensure spectrum availability at affordable prices with uniform right of way for fiberisation.",

         "content":"An economy such as India can ill-afford the shocks of disruption or be held hostage by an over-reliance on imports\n\nA key lesson learnt by the world during the COVID-19 pandemic has been the importance of creating resilient supply chains that can withstand disruptions and ensure reliability for the global economy.\n\nDisruptions in supply chains can be natural or man-made. In Japan\u2019s case, the Great T\u014dhoku Earthquake of 2011, followed by the Tsunami, led to a nuclear disaster (Fukushima Daiichi), causing a sharp drop in Japanese automobile exports to the United States.\n\nComment | Helping supply chains recover\n\nExamples that hit home\n\nMan-made interruptions in supply chains are equally disruptive. Terrorist drone attacks on Aramco\u2019s oil refineries at Abqaiq and Khurais in Saudi Arabia in September 2019 resulted in a drop of 5.7 million barrels of oil per day, triggering a steep plunge in Saudi Arabia\u2019s stock market and a sharp spike in global oil prices.\n\nChina has long practised \u201csupply chain politics\u201d. Japanese entrepreneurs learnt a hard lesson when the detention of a Chinese fishing trawler captain in 2010 near the disputed Senkaku Islands resulted in the Chinese government cutting off exports of rare earths to Japan.\n\nWhen the novel coronavirus pandemic broke out, it had an immediate and telling effect on supply chains emanating from China. In India, several companies felt the disruption in the automotive, electronics and white goods sectors. India excels in the pharmaceuticals sector but the over-reliance on Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) from China still creates vulnerabilities in the value chain.\n\nAlso read | Pandemic to hasten investment in building supply chain resilience: Experts\n\nTensions with China led the United States government to impose restrictions on export of microchips to China\u2019s biggest semiconductor manufacturer, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), following assessment that there was an \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d that equipment supplied to it could be used for military purposes.\n\nA new initiative\n\nGreater weaponisation of trade and technology is here to stay. It is in this context that India, Japan and Australia initiated the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) in September this year, focusing on automobiles and parts, petroleum, steel, textiles, financial services and IT sectors. The SCRI may be bolstered by the future involvement of France, though this might depend on the European Union\u2019s position. The United Kingdom has also shown interest in the SCRI.\n\nAlso read | Blockchain can tackle supply chain failures exposed by COVID-19, boost economic recovery: World Economic Forum\n\nGeo-politics and geo-economics can never be truly separated. This is what Henry Kissinger called the \u201cprinciple of linkage\u201d in his analysis of U.S. relations with the Soviet Union. When the Nixon administration came to power in 1969, the Soviet Union wanted access to some key western technologies in computing. Yet, it was unwilling to accommodate U.S. concerns on strategic and military issues. Kissinger clearly pointed out that to \u201cseparate issues into distinct compartments would encourage the Soviet leaders to believe that they could use cooperation in one area as a safety valve while striving for unilateral advantages elsewhere....\u201d\n\nChina has resorted to similar tactics, of maintaining advantageous trade and economic engagement, without relenting on strategic issues. China\u2019s calls for \u201cnormal relations\u201d with India are unrealistic given the continuing face-off in Ladakh.\n\nAlso read | U.S. urges India to enhance its position in global supply chain\n\nMoves by Australia, Japan\n\nChina has often used its economic leverage to weaken an opponent\u2019s resolve on contentious issues. Facing such a dilemma, Australia has demonstrated strong political will in countering arbitrary Chinese sanctions imposed on its key exports of grain, beef, wine, coal and much else. This is a price that a democracy such as Australia finds worth paying, for demanding an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus and advocating a robust Indo-Pacific vision.\n\nSince the normalisation of diplomatic ties in the 1970s, Japan has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in the Chinese economy. For many Japanese companies, global performance and profits are linked to manufacturing facilities and supply chains in China. Yet, they have shown an early capacity for risk mitigation through the \u201cChina Plus One\u201d business strategy, aimed at diversification of investments to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), India and Bangladesh.\n\nAlso read | From carats to peanuts: how a pandemic upended the global diamond industry\n\nIn Phase-1 of Japan\u2019s $2.2 billion Relocation Package announced this year, 89 Japanese companies availed subsidies to diversify out of China. Of these, 57 companies relocated to Japan, 30 to Southeast Asia and two to India.\n\nA sizeable number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) chose to relocate to Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. That in itself is hardly surprising since Japanese entrepreneurs are far more familiar with the cultural and business environment in ASEAN countries as compared to South Asia.\n\nHowever, companies in health care and medical devices, especially those manufacturing personal protective equipment (PPEs), would have benefited more by shifting to India which offers a much larger domestic market as well as lower manufacturing costs for global exports.\n\nThe Hindu Explains | Why has Japan mooted the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative?\n\nIndia\u2019s vulnerabilities\n\nA large emerging economy such as India can ill-afford the shocks of disruption in supply chains. Nor can it allow itself to be held hostage due to an over-reliance on imports. For instance, the pandemic caused a breakdown in global supply chains in the automotive sector since most global manufacturers in China abruptly went offline. For India, which imports 27% of its requirement of automotive parts from China, this quandary was a wake-up call, given the sudden shortage of braking components, electrical components, interiors and lighting fixtures.\n\nWhat is noteworthy is that despite being the fourth largest market in Asia for medical devices, India has an import dependency of 80%. Among the biggest exporters to India in this field are China, the U.S., Germany, Singapore and Japan. This is clearly not sustainable. Given the renewed thrust in the health-care sector, this is the right time to fill gaps through local manufacturing.\n\nAlso read | Supply chain shift from China may benefit India: Survey\n\nIndia\u2019s electronics industry was worth $120 billion in 2018-2019 and is forecast to grow to $400 billion by 2025. Today, India is seeking to enhance its presence substantially in the global supply chains by attracting investments in the semiconductor components and packaging industry. The government is actively promoting domestic manufacture of printed circuit boards (PCBs), components and semiconductors, as the Indian electronics sector gradually shifts away from completely knocked down (CKD) assembly to high value addition.\n\nDefence beckons\n\nDefence is among the key pillars of the \u2018Atmanirbhar Bharat\u2019 policy. The government is providing a big boost to defence manufacturing under the \u2018Make in India\u2019 programme. It has identified a negative import list of 101 items. There is a tremendous opportunity for foreign companies to enter into tie-ups with reputed Indian defence manufacturers to tap into the growing defence market in India.\n\nThe push for self-reliance through \u2018Atmanirbhar Bharat\u2019 is not an autarkic policy. It does not imply foreclosure of the Indian economy to foreign trade and participation in the global economy. On the contrary, it is aimed at strengthening India\u2019s capacities to participate more vigorously without being prey to supply chain disruptions.\n\nAlso read | India to play vital role in equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines around the world: Pharma industry\n\nIndia has the capacity and the potential to become one of the world\u2019s largest destinations for investments, and one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturing hubs, in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nSujan R.

         "content":"People eventually adopt healthy behaviors \u2013 but it can take time we don\u2019t have during a pandemic.\n\nWhy do we do things that are bad for us \u2013 or not do things that are good for us \u2013 even in light of overwhelming evidence?\n\nAs someone with a long career in pharmacy, I have witnessed some pretty dramatic shifts in public health behavior. But I won\u2019t sugarcoat it. It generally takes years \u2013 or even decades \u2013 of dragging people, kicking and screaming, to finally achieve new and improved societal norms.\n\nThis plodding time course seems to be an innate human defect that existed long before the current-day pandemic mask and social distancing conundrums. Historically, people aren\u2019t fond of being told what to do.\n\nNotable victories\n\nAttitudes toward smoking have undergone dramatic changes over the past 50 years. Although there has been a gradual decline in smoking, from 42% of the American population in 1965 to the low teens today, there still are a lot of smokers in the U.S. \u2013 and premature deaths due to smoking. Even health care workers fall prey to this unhealthy and highly addictive habit.\n\nThere was a strongly held view that smoking was a personal decision that do-gooders and the government should keep their noses out of \u2013 until the issue was framed differently by studies showing harm caused by secondhand smoke. You are welcome to do what you want to yourself, but it becomes a horse of a different color when it affects others.\n\nToday, public smoking restrictions have become commonplace. But this change in societal behavior didn\u2019t happen overnight or without painful discourse. The journey from the initial 1964 surgeon general\u2019s report on smoking and health to the 2006 surgeon general\u2019s report on secondhand smoke to today was a fractious one.\n\nAnother about-face has been the adoption of seat belts. Seat belts save lives. And most people now use them as a result of the nagging warning alarm, the marketing of automobile safety, the law and the data.\n\nThis change in behavior, however, followed a rocky road over many years. In my earlier days, I can remember more than one occasion when I hopped into a friend\u2019s car, put on my seat belt and was then chastised for having so little faith in my friend\u2019s driving ability.\n\nSeat belts were required to be installed in new cars starting in 1964 and New York enacted the first seat belt use law in 1984. In the U.S., seat belt use rose from 14% in 1983 to 90% in 2016.\n\nContinuing challenges\n\nIn the medical arena, much effort has been expended in promoting healthy behaviors \u2013 diet, exercise, sleep hygiene, adherence to prescribed drugs and immunizations. Frankly, the success has been mixed.\n\nStudies have suggested many possible variables associated with not following accepted medical advice: age, gender, race, education, literacy, income, insurance copays, level of physician and pharmacist care \u2013 and plain old stubbornness. But there is no single, easily addressable cause of nonadherence to healthy behaviors.\n\nFor example, properly prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins literally add years to patients\u2019 lives by reducing heart attacks and strokes. Even in people with insurance coverage and minimal side effects, 50% of patients discontinue statin therapy within one year of receiving their first prescription.\n\nVaccines and immunization offer another window into the puzzle of human behavior. Life expectancy in the U.S. rose from 40 years in 1860 to 70 years in 1960. These gains resulted largely from decreased infant and child mortality due to infectious diseases. A better understanding of infectious diseases along with scientific advances, vaccines and antibacterial drugs were the primary factors for this profound increase in life expectancy.\n\nCommon sense alone makes the value of vaccines abundantly clear; how many people do you know who are suffering from polio or smallpox? Yet some intelligent, thoughtful friends, family and neighbors are convinced vaccines are not helpful and are even harmful. Some believe wearing a mask is nothing more than a \u201cfeel good\u201d placebo. I believe these contrarian beliefs make better press and are therefore more frequently reported than mainstream ones, but clearly there is reason for concern.\n\nThe current crisis\n\nHistorically, changes in societal behavior that benefit public health occur in fits and starts \u2013 and never fast enough for the individuals who fall victim before society comes around.\n\nThe urgency imposed by the coronavirus has actually resulted in comparatively swift behavioral changes (masks, hand-washing, distancing) in the U.S. \u2013 as scientists learned how the coronavirus is spread, how dangerous it can be and which groups are more susceptible. But these behavioral changes were not as complete or as fast as they should \u2013 or could \u2013 have been when judged by far better outcomes in other countries.\n\nI am discouraged by the battle between the scientific method and political ideology when it comes to public health. Ideology never seems to change and is therefore more comforting to some \u2013 while science evolves as new findings debunk old ideas or confirm new ones. It is clear to all who want to listen: controlling the virus and maintaining the economy is not an either/or choice \u2013 they are interdependent.\n\nAt the same time, I am buoyed that the tide seems to be turning. As a better understanding of treating COVID-19 has emerged and with more than one highly effective vaccine on the horizon, the \u201cidiot scientists\u201d are gaining ground, both in the lab and at the bedside. Even the most prominent ideologues run to the hospital to get the best treatments science can offer when the effect of their maskless behavior rears up to bite them.\n\nBut as history suggests, the science, no matter how great, is only the beginning of implementation in a divided population. Ultimately, both the citizenry and the economy will benefit from a shot in the arm.\n\nRandy P.

         "content":"Hello, communicators:\n\nChinese brand Purcotton issued a mea culpa after backlash over its recent ad, which shows a woman being followed down a dimly-lit street by a man wearing a mask. As the man approaches, the woman uses a Purcotton wipe to remove her makeup, which scares away the would-be attacker.\n\nCNN reported:\n\n\u2026 Purcotton originally defended the advertisement as a creative way to advertise the \u201ccleaning function of the product,\u201d but as the calls for a boycott grew, the company removed the video from their accounts and eventually apologized on January 8. \u201cWe have set up a team to hold people to account for the problem and, in the meantime, we will improve content production and the review process to prevent similar incidents from happening again,\u201d the company\u2019s post said. Purcotton posted a second apology letter to their Weibo account on Monday.\n\nHere are today\u2019s top stories:\n\nPGA cuts ties with Trump as brands pause political donations\n\nThe PGA of America announced that it won\u2019t play its 2022 Championship tournament at the Trump National Gold Club Bedminster, quickly distancing itself from President Donald Trump as political and business fallout continues after last week\u2019s riots at the U.S. Capitol building. Five people died in the attacks and several more were wounded.\n\n\"The PGA of America Board of Directors voted tonight to exercise the right to terminate the agreement to play the 2022 PGA Championship at Trump Bedminster.\" \u2014 Jim Richerson, PGA of America President \u2014 PGA of America (@PGA) January 11, 2021\n\nAdAge reported:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become clear that conducting the PGA championship at Trump Bedminster would be detrimental to the PGA of America brand and would put at risk the PGA\u2019s ability to deliver our many programs and sustain the longevity of our mission,\u201d Jim Richerson, PGA of America\u2019s president, said in a video message.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Jonathan O\u2019Connell tweeted a response from the Trump organization\u2019s spokesman:\n\n\"As an organization we have invested many, many millions of dollars in the 2022 PGA Championship at Trump National Golf Club, Bedminster. We will continue to promote the game of golf on every level and remain focused on operating the finest golf courses anywhere in the world.\" \u2014 Jonathan O'Connell (@OConnellPostbiz) January 11, 2021\n\nSeveral organizations, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Marriott, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and JPMorgan Chase are also distancing themselves from last week\u2019s attacks by suspending some or all of their political donations.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported:\n\nJPMorgan, the largest bank in the country, made the decision to pause political giving for the next six months because of the growing political crisis following the violence at the Capitol alongside health and economic crises, said Peter Scher, JPMorgan\u2019s head of corporate responsibility, in an interview. \u201cThe focus of business leaders, political leaders, civic leaders right now should be on governing and getting help to those who desperately need it most right now,\u201d said Mr. Scher, who is also chairman of the bank\u2019s Mid-Atlantic region. \u201cThere will be plenty of time for campaigning later.\u201d\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The House of Representatives is pushing for Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and is planning to carry out impeachment legislation this week, according to NPR. Yet, lawmakers are far from the only ones to respond to last week\u2019s violence. Many executives have condemned the riots, while others have called for unity ahead of President-elect Joseph Biden\u2019s inauguration. Brands such as Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Axe have also spoken out on Twitter.\n\nAs the political fallout for the Trump administration continues, you can expect more organizations to cut ties with both Trump\u2019s brand as well as potentially reputation-damaging political partnerships. Forbes\u2019 chief content officer and editor, Randall Lane, even published an article titled: \u201cA truth reckoning: Why we\u2019re holding those who lied for Trump accountable.\u201d\n\nTACTICALLY SPEAKING\n\nGeneral Motors overhauled its design and launched a new campaign that focuses on its goal of a zero-emissions future.

Our public interest framework exists to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly. It is built on a principle that the people have a right to hold power to account in the open. However, we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules entirely and cannot use Twitter to incite violence, among other things. We will continue to be transparent around our policies and their enforcement.\n\nTwitter\u2019s move is one in a running list of social media platforms suspending Trump or banning pro-Trump accounts and campaigns, such as #StoptheSteal groups or Reddit\u2019s \u201cr/DonaldTrump\u201d subreddit. Axios reported that Shopify, Twitch, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Stripe, Pinterest and Discord have either cut ties with Trump or banned related content.\n\nAmazon Web Service also terminated hosting services for social media app Parler, following both Google and Apple banning Parler from their app stores.\n\nThe Verge reported:\n\nParler launched in 2018 presenting itself as a free-speech haven and an alternative to other social media sites. The site saw its user numbers spike in recent months, as Twitter and Facebook tightened their moderation policies, especially around election and coronavirus information. The \u201cStop the Steal\u201d campaign challenging President Trump\u2019s loss gained momentum among Parler users, as did other conspiracy theories around the election. Parler\u2019s less-strict moderation policies were part of its appeal for many users, but the lack of content moderation is a big part of why companies suspended their services.\n\nWhy it matters: As organizations across industries scramble to distance themselves from both the riots and from the Trump administration, social media and tech companies have continued to grapple with content that promotes or incites violence, as well as growing misinformation. Recent suspensions and bans aren\u2019t just to protect their brands\u2019 images, either. Rather, the companies are doing what they can ahead of impending regulations that could make them more liable for the content published on their platforms.\n\nSOCIAL BUZZ\n\nThe social media team for Innocent Drinks recently tweeted a thread promoting vitamin D supplements, using a humorous story about the company\u2019s resident nutritionist, Louisa:\n\nATTENTION EVERYONE Our resident nutritionist Louisa is pestering us to \u201ctweet about how people should take vitamin D supplements at this time of year\u201d so please accept this as us tweeting that you should take vitamin D supplements at this time of year.

However, the sudden boost in digital transformation also attracted bad attention. In June 2020, personal and financial data of 2.91 crore Indians was leaked on to the dark web, and 3.24 million personal records were stolen or exposed in case of identity theft across India. We spoke to Ram Seethepalli, CEO, Europ Assistance India about why India needs tougher cybersecurity, why it needs to guard against cyberattacks, and educate users against cyber thefts.\n\ntech2: Why do you think India needs tougher cybersecurity?\n\nSeethepalli: The COVID pandemic has fast-tracked the digital transformation across all aspects of operations and processes not only in India but across the world. India has the third-largest digital population in the world. The move towards the digital has encouraged countless organisations to shift to online mediums. Professional work, schooling and education, shopping, entertainment, everything is now digital. As an increasing number of companies and institutions adapt to the virtual model, it is essential that we consider the necessity of cybersecurity. For India especially, raising awareness and taking concrete steps to prevent malicious attacks on multiple forums is imperative.\n\nAside from formal threats to organizations, it is imperative to remember the threat that individuals face. Presently, India consists of over half a billion internet users. Most internet users possess a smartphone, complete with a multitude of apps ready to dispense services to cater to almost all their needs. Digital payment methods such as UPI and other mobile wallets play an important role in facilitating transactions. Unfortunately, this trend towards the digital can spell trouble for consumers unless proper protective measures are undertaken.\n\nIndia is among the top countries in the world that falls prey to cyberattacks and cyber thefts. Data suggests the situation has worsened with the onset of the pandemic. In the first nine months of 2020 alone, there has been an estimated loss of $6 trillion to organisations and individuals. This indicates just how necessary it is for us to seriously consider cybersecurity, on a macro as well as micro-level.\n\ntech2: What are the most common types of cyberattacks that Cyberior can guard against?\n\nSeethepalli: Broadly speaking, most cybercrimes happen in one of three ways.\n\nThe primary technique involves breaching security at the server level, usually in companies. Once these boundaries are breached and sensitive information is gained, this information is sold on the dark web. Other cybercriminals can then access this sensitive information on the dark web, which includes users\u2019 login credentials, personally identifiable information and sensitive data such as photos or documents. These cybercriminals can then use this information to access user accounts, extort the users, and commit fraud in the user\u2019s name by assuming their identity. Such data breaches have been reported in the news time and again. Even the largest of organizations, with multiple layers of cybersecurity, are susceptible to breaches of user data.\n\nNext, we look at malicious software that targets devices. Malware, the kind of software designed to damage or compromise device security, such as viruses or ransomware are threats to user devices and data. They infiltrate devices through various ways such as downloads or links on unverified websites, social media, spam emails and even messaging platforms. Once this malicious software has made its way to the system, it can compromise the security of the device in several ways. The malware can lock down your system and demanding a ransom to return your sensitive data or it can syphon your sensitive data to be used by the cybercriminal to commit fraud in your name by assuming your identity.\n\nFinally, there are scams. Even with data that isn\u2019t considered sensitive in the conventional sense, such as a user\u2019s name, date of birth and address, cybercriminals can cause significant damage to the user. Such information can be found easily via social media. Cybercriminals can use this data to claim to represent the user\u2019s banks or other financial institutions. On the pretext of offers or other processes, the cybercriminals can manipulate the user into giving up other vulnerable information, such as their personally identifiable information or financial information.\n\nCybersecurity threats and scams are always evolving. As more services become digital, more malware and scams are developed to take advantage of the digital nature of these services. However, cybersecurity solutions are also adapting to the needs of the user to combat these newer and improved cybersecurity threats.\n\ntech2: What is your view on the current cybersecurity threat level in India?\n\nSeethepalli: The surface area for cybercriminals who attack individuals was already large, to begin with, because of the blooming digital network. In the last couple of decades, trends show that internet usage, especially in India, has increased substantially. Although the need for cybersecurity dates back much before COVID, the pandemic has definitely exacerbated the situation by hastening multiple organisations to go digital.\n\nAs most of us work from home, our devices and company data can be intercepted with more ease than in official setups. However, the real threat of cybercrimes is to individuals. Most of the cybercrimes that occur in India happen through smartphones. It is thus crucial to empower every person with cybersecurity measures as the threat is more than ever today. Cyber thefts and identity thefts can have a lasting impact on one\u2019s life, completely compromising his/her credibility on various platforms. Not only can cyberattacks cause tangible financial loss, but it can also cause sustained mental agony.\n\nProjected data suggests India will have 900 million people on digital platforms by 2027. We must brace ourselves with all necessary precautions to ensure the transition to the digital is a smooth and safe one.\u201d\n\nAs of January 2020, there were more than 650 million internet users in India. This was an increase of over 20 percent from 2019, which is an increase of over 120 million users within a year. Even today this is less than 50 percent of the Indian population.\n\nAn important point to consider is the nascence of the digital audience in India. As a result of the increased availability and affordability of data and smartphones, paired with events like the lockdowns of the Covid-19 pandemic, there are so many new users of digital services in India. This means that many new users are not aware of the kind of threats that can be used to cause harm to these new users. These new users need to be educated about the kind of threats that exist and the tools that they can equip themselves with to protect themselves in the digital world.\n\ntech2: What role does Cyberior play in this ecosystem?\n\nSeethepalli: Cyberior provides a one-stop solution for a variety of cyber threats as it aims to penetrate to the end consumer level. Services include breach monitoring, digital identity monitoring, credit services, alerts and notifications, financial loss coverage and crisis resolution. From a B2B2C perspective, our clients include banks, insurance companies, and credit card companies to airlines, cruise ship companies, hotels and automobile manufacturers.

         "title":"History Made: The Tondern Raid Was the First Air Strike From a Carrier",
         "Prediction_result":1,
         "content":"Key point: The attack actually worked and changed history. Here is how the Royal Navy managed to pull the attack off.\n\nNearly a century ago during World War I, the Royal Navy launched the first air strike from an aircraft carrier ever, targeting a zeppelin base in Tondern. After dropping a cumulative bomb load that barely exceeded the weight of a single five-hundred-pound bomb carried by a typical World War II fighter, the naval strike planes all proceeded to crash in the sea or were forced to land on neutral territory.\n\nThis attack actually constituted an enormous success\u2014and remains a landmark in the history of naval aviation.\n\nThis first appeared earlier and is being reposted due to reader interest.\n\nTo be clear, ship-launched seaplanes preceded their carrier-launched counterparts in battle. The Japanese took the initiative by deploying ship-launched Farman seaplanes against German ships off of Qingdao in 1914. The Royal Navy soon followed in December with a ship-launched seaplane raid on a German airbase near Cuxhaven. However, though highly useful for spying upon enemy ship movements and hunting submarines, seaplanes could not be launched or recovered very quickly\u2014they need to be lifted into the water by crane\u2014and their performance was compromised by their underslung pontoons.\n\nThe American aviation pioneer Eugene Ely had proved it was possible to fly an airplane onto a ship when he took off and landed on a platform built atop the battleship USS Pennsylvania while it sat at dock. This was only achieved with great difficulty\u2014and the Pennsylvania had not even been moving. During World War I, navies did devise launch platforms that could dispatch conventional fighters from atop the turrets of heavy cruisers or battleships. But each ship could only carry a few aircraft, and these would have to ditch at sea after being launched.\n\nThe Royal Navy was enthusiastic about sea-launched aircraft, in part because it had a zeppelin problem. The giant German airships, typically measuring six hundred feet long\u2014two football fields back to back\u2014were widely employed in spying upon Royal Navy ships, and occasionally trying to bomb them. Seaplanes sent to chase them down often couldn\u2019t fly high enough to shoot them down. In 1916, in an effort to stamp out the problem at its source, the Royal Navy sailed up off the coast of Germany and deployed eleven seaplanes to scout out and destroy one of the zeppelin bases. They discovered its exact location near Tondern, which lies in present-day Denmark, but failed to inflict much damage upon it.\n\nAs it happened, the Royal Navy was nearly done building the last of its twenty-thousand-ton Courageous-class battlecruisers\u2014a ship type it no longer really wanted. These were meant to be \u201clarge light cruisers\u201d: ships as fast as light cruisers but with the guns of a battleship. The Courageous class took the concept to the extreme by mounting two enormous eighteen-inch guns so powerful that simply firing them blew rivets out the ship\u2019s hull. High speed was achieved by sacrificing armor protection under the mantra that \u201cspeed was armor.\u201d\n\nBattlecruisers were supposed to chase down smaller ships that didn\u2019t have the firepower to fight back. However, give a navy a two-hundred-meter-long ship with large guns and it will send them fight other vessels the same size. In the Battle of Jutland, British battle cruisers charged the German High Seas Fleet\u2014and lost three of their number to titanic ammunition explosion in the gun turrets. No longer enamored with the lightly armored capital ships, British naval planners decided to convert the last of the new Courageous-class vessels into an aircraft carrier. This was accomplished by replacing the front turret with a small hangar that had a 160-foot flight deck on top.\n\nThe Furious\u2019s Sopwith Pup fighters could take off from this short flight deck\u2014but not land on it. To address this shortcoming, in the winter of 1917\u201318 the Furious\u2019s rear gun turret was replaced with a second three-hundred-foot flight deck. The Royal Navy had devised a method in which a Pup flying into a stiff headwind could actually almost match velocity with the Furious as it sailed at a maximum speed! (Yes, World War I aircraft were very slow.) The Pup would approach parallel to the carrier then slide sideways towards the deck, where waiting flight crew would leap up and hook arresting cables to leather straps under the airplane, bringing it down to the deck.\n\nIf this sounds extremely dangerous and unreliable . . . it was. Squadron Commander Edwin Dunning was the first pilot to pull off a landing on the deck of the Furious\u2014indeed, the first landing ever on a moving ship. However, he died when his Pup flipped off the deck while attempting his third landing. Part of the problem was that tall superstructure in the middle of the Furious\u2019s deck created intolerable turbulence for approaching aircraft. Of the subsequent eleven attempted landings, only three succeeded.\n\nThe Royal Navy concluded it had a good platform for launching fighter planes\u2014but not recovering them. The new plan was for the pilots to ditch their aircraft at sea, where escorting destroyers could recover both the plane and the pilot. If everything worked perfectly\u2014and frequently it didn\u2019t\u2014the naval fighter could be recovered intact and its fabric skin replaced. Unlike today\u2019s multimillion-dollar jets, World War I aircraft were relatively cheap to manufacture and considered expendable. The use of \u201cdisposable\u201d fighters even continued into World War II in the form of CAM ships that could rocket Hurricane fighters up into the sky to protect Atlantic convoys from air attack\u2014without any expectation of finding a safe place to land.\n\nBy 1918, the Royal Navy had a new plane specially designed for the Furious: the 2F.1 Ship\u2019s Camel. These were a variant of the highly maneuverable Sopwith Camel, the iconic British fighter of World War I. To put things in perspective, the Camel had performance specs comparable to your contemporary automobile, with a top speed of 113 miles per hour and a maximum range of three hundred miles.\n\nThe navalized 2F.1 had shorter wings, a folding tail for easier storage on the deck, and hooks so that ship-mounted cranes could easily fish them out of the water after ditching. Even the landing gear was designed to be jettisoned for safer water landings. The 2F.1 had a new Bentley BR1 engine and swapped one of the two synchronized Vickers machine guns shooting through the propeller for an overwing Lewis gun, thought to be more convenient for attacking zeppelins from below. In addition, it could carry eighty to one hundred pounds of bombs\u2014roughly equivalent in weight to a single heavy artillery shell.\n\nThe Furious also carried Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutter attack planes, but these were reserved mostly for observation missions, which were in high demand.\n\nThe Furious now carried capable carrier-based fighters and could muster seven experienced pilots trained to operate them\u2014but how was it to use them? As the zeppelin base in Tondern was the only one within range, it seemed an appropriate target.\n\nHowever, the first attempted raid late in June 1918 failed, as heavy winds made launch of the aircraft impossible. The Furious and its escorts were forced to abort mission so as not to risk discovery.\n\nThe Furious set off again three weeks later on July 17, escorted by a squadron each of cruisers and battleships, as well as an escort screen of destroyers. The plan of Operation F7 was to sail the force up to twelve miles off the German coast. From there, the Camels would take off in two waves and use the Danish Lyngvig Lighthouse as a navigational aid as they flew along the coast toward the zeppelin storage hangars in Tondern, which they would attack with two fifty-pound Cooper bombs. However, should they encounter any airborne zeppelins on the mission, they were to prioritize attacking those, even if it meant ditching the bombs and giving up the fuel necessary to make it back home. The British military was willing to go to great expense to destroy the high-flying airships!\n\nAgain the Furious encountered heavy winds when it arrived at the launch point on July 18, but they quieted down by early morning on July 19. At 3 a.m. the carrier began launching the 2F.1 fighters, a process that took twenty minutes. Immediately, the Camel of Captain T. K. Thyne developed engine problems. He ditched his plane and was rescued, but his airplane was accidentally run over by the destroyer sent to pick it up!\n\nIt took the first wave of three Camels an hour and a half of flying time to traverse the eighty miles to Tondern and locate the airbase. Of the base\u2019s three hangars, two smaller ones, named \u201cToni\u201d and \u201cTobias,\u201d could each accommodate a single zeppelin, but both were empty that morning. However, there were two zeppelins\u2014L54 and L60\u2014inside the massive 740-by-130-foot hanger named \u201cToska.\u201d\n\nCapt. W. F. Dickson led the attack, though his bombs reportedly missed. His wingmen were more successful\u2014the little bombs pierced the roof the Toska mega-hangar and set the zeppelin\u2019s superstructure ablaze.",

The vehicles include sophisticated controllers that manage data collected through a network of sensors in real-time.\n\nTo have an idea of the complexity of a modern vehicle, let\u2019s consider that a controller of a luxury car has more than 100 million lines of computer code, while software and electronics account for 40% of the cost of the car.\n\nEvery component in a car and its communication channels could potentially be targeted by cybercriminals.\n\nWhat are the attack vectors for smart cars?\n\nSecurity experts have demonstrated multiple attack techniques against connected cars. Some of them were also exploited by cybercriminals in real attack scenarios.\n\nHere are the most popular car hacking techniques:\n\nAttacks against telematics systems . Telematics systems allow vehicles to communicate with a remote center and exchange with it the telemetry data and other information. Some car manufacturers already offer their customers telemetry services for a remote diagnostic that could prevent accidental crashes and electronic faults. Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in these systems to potentially interfere with onboard components, and modify their parameters to alter the response of the vehicle to the driver\u2019s orders.\n\n\n\n.

For example, using a USB stick inserted into an MP3 reader or through wireless technology (wifi, Bluetooth, mobile communication). Unauthorized applications . On-board computers can download and execute applications and related updates. A threat actor could tamper with these applications to get malicious code executed on the target vehicle.

Tailormade software could exploit the OBD-II (on-board diagnostics) port for installation. Once the connector is accessed via the CAN bus, it is possible to monitor every component connected to it. Door locks and key fobs. An attacker could emulate the presence of access code used by key fobs and door locks to control locks and start/stop for car engines.\n\nOur vehicles are similar to a network of computers that communicate in an \u201cunsecure\u201d way on the internal bus. This means that hackers could take over a vehicle by sending a large number of controller area network packets (both normal packets and diagnostic packets) on the CAN bus to internal components. If the malicious packets arrive at the ECUs before the legitimate packets, these components consider them as valid.\n\nNormal packets could be sent by attackers to manipulate multiple components, including the car\u2019s speedometer, odometer, on-board navigation system, steering, brakes, and acceleration.\n\nAttackers could send diagnostic packets to alter the behavior of some of the components in the vehicle such as brakes management, kill engine, lights flashing, doors lock/unlock, and modification of fuel gauge.\n\nUnlike normal packets, diagnostic activities against an ECU need to be authenticated. However, weak implementation of the authentication process poses serious risks to the users.\n\nThreat actors could target modern vehicles for multiple reasons, from sabotage to cyber espionage. An attacker could launch an attack to take over the car and cause a crash or to gather information stored by on board systems that could allow it to spy on the owner.\n\nVehicle protection\n\nCar makers should implement security by design for the internal architecture of the vehicles. Here are some of the essential mitigations proposed by security researchers:\n\nImplement network segmentation to avoid threat actors exploiting security flaws in a component in order to access the rest of the network, including critical units.\n\nImplement authentication or authorization for any component connected through the CAN bus.\n\nEncrypt the traffic on the CAN bus.\n\nSecurity researchers also suggest implementing anomaly detection mechanisms to prevent cyberattacks. An anomaly detection mechanism can leverage patterns for \u201cnormal\u201d behavior for any component in the vehicle. Any deviation from this baseline must be analyzed and countermeasures can be potentially activated. Researchers Miller and Valasek suggested real-time analysis of CAN packets over time to detect potentially malicious traffic.\n\nUnfortunately, in many cases, auto manufacturers avoid increasing the complexity of the vehicles by adding additional defense systems.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of attacks, experts recommend manually applying software security patches provided by the car makers when the vendors don\u2019t push them \u2018over the air\u2019.\n\nAvoid installing any software that is not approved by the car manufacturer and don\u2019t install updates downloaded from third-party repositories. This includes diagnostics software to monitor your car\u2019s performance or different types of entertainment software that has Internet connectivity. Third-party software could be affected by vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers to steal or take over your car.\n\nResearchers and authorities have to support and urge the automotive industry in implementing mandatory requirements for the safety and security of the vehicles.",

         "title":"History Questions: Why Did So Many Generals Survive World War II?",
         "Prediction_result":1,
         "content":"Nearly 1,100 U.S. Army generals served at some point during World War II, and of those about 40 died during or immediately following the war.\n\nHere's What You Need To Remember: Most of the generals who died during the Second World War were executed by their nation's leader for incompetence.\n\nGeneral George S. Patton, Jr., once said, \u201cAn army is like a piece of cooked spaghetti. You can\u2019t push it, you have to pull it after you.\u201d He was referring to commanders being leaders as he had little use for commanders that were not out in front of their units. This attitude was the norm in the U.S. military in World War II, and the amazement is not that a few dozen general officers were lost, but that U.S. armed forces did not lose more!\n\nLeaders being out front or is not a unique military concept, nor exclusively that of the United States. Since the earliest days of recorded warfare, the good leaders have always been at the forefront of battle.\n\nSome nations have a unique concept of control over military leadership. This was especially evident in the Soviet Union in the years before the onset of World War II. During the war, Hitler not only directed military battles, but controlled the general officer corps to an incredible, and as it turned out, disastrous degree.\n\nRussia and Germany Both Hard Up for Officers\n\nA few years before World War II Soviet Dictator Josef Stalin purged the Soviet military of most of its high ranking and experienced officers. During his frenzied attack on the officer ranks through the end of 1938, Stalin had executed at least 65,000 officers, including 13 of 15 generals of the army, 93 percent of all officers ranked lieutenant general and above, and 58 percent of all officers ranked colonel through major general. Ironically, one of the few senior commanders to survive, Dimitri Pavlov, would be executed within days of Germany\u2019s invasion of the Soviet Union because of incompetence.\n\nAfter the war started, Germany was equally hard on general officers. During the course of the war, Hitler executed 84 German generals, and another 135 generals were killed in action.\n\nDemoting Officers Who Fall Behind Expectations\n\nThe United States, of course, has never had a policy of executing officers, even for inexcusable failures. The U.S. does have a tradition, such as that displayed following the disaster at Pearl Harbor, of relieving and even demoting officers that fail to meet expectations. Two flag officers, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter Short, were relieved of command and demoted after the Pearl Harbor attack as they were, rightly or wrongly, held responsible for failure to plan for this eventuality.\n\nThe United States suffered about 407,000 military deaths during World War II. The vast majority of those killed were enlisted and lower ranking officers. However, there were some \u201cfallen stars\u201d as well. Nearly 1,100 U.S. Army generals served at some point during World War II, and of those about 40 died during or immediately following the war. Not all were in combat units, and some were not in enemy territory when they died.\n\n40 Out of 1,100\n\nOf these generals, at least 11 were killed in action or died of wounds from hostile actions, two were executed by the Japanese while POWs, four were killed in plane crashes, one was killed by friendly fire, and five died of natural causes, including two of heart attacks. The remainder died of various causes in the first few months after the end of hostilities.\n\nFollowing are brief sketches of some of these American officers that were lost\u2014some in battle, some by accident, some by natural causes\u2014during the course of World War II. Some generals who died during the war are not mentioned here because it has been impossible to find anything more than a line noting their death. In one case, the record simply says \u201ccircumstances of death unknown.\u201d This is, without doubt, because of the chaos of war.\n\nGeneral Gustav J. Braun, Jr. was the assistant division commander of the 34th Division at the time of his death in 1945 in combat in Italy. The 34th Division was a National Guard unit from Iowa. Braun had served in various staff positions within the 34th, including chief of staff and commander of the 133rd Regiment, a subordinate unit. The 34th Division had fought some of the fiercest battles in all of the war, and at war\u2019s end the division\u2019s losses included 3,737 killed, 14,165 wounded, and 3,450 missing in action.\n\nThe 34th Division had fought its way up the Italian peninsula and was in the shadows of Monte Bel Monte and its well-entrenched German defenders. Elements of the 34th Division attacked the defenders, with limited success. The arrival of deep winter led to both sides digging in to wait for spring thaws. It was during this stalemate when Braun was killed. He was flying in a light aircraft on reconnaissance when it was shot down by enemy gunfire.\n\nThe nominal infantry division size during World War II was approximately 12,300 soldiers. Additional attached specialty units, such as engineers, intelligence, or medical often brought the total to about 15,000. The 34th Division was reconstituted several times to maintain its effective combat strength while sustaining such heavy losses.\n\nLt. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr., was the commanding general of the 10th Army and was one of the highest ranking American officers killed in action during the war. Buckner\u2019s 10th Army consisted of two corps, the III Amphibious Corps made up of the 1st, 6th, and 2nd Marine divisions, and the XXIV Corps with the 7th, 27th, 77th, and 96th Infantry divisions.\n\nThe final battle for Okinawa, and what proved to be the final land campaign of World War II, was viciously fought from the north to the south. The campaign began on April 1, 1945, and lasted 82 days. During the final days of the battle, Buckner was killed by an artillery fragment. He was one of approximately 7,000 Americans killed in this battle that also saw the deaths of 110,000 Japanese soldiers by the time the battle ended on June 22, 1945.\n\nBuckner\u2019s father, Confederate General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr., had surrendered to Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Fort Donelson during the Civil War. Some have argued, perhaps wanting to prove that the apple does not fall far from the tree, that Buckner, Jr., was a racist and prejudiced against most minorities. Prior to his Pacific adventures, Buckner had commanded troops in Alaska and was derisive in his comments about African-American soldiers as well as native Alaskans.\n\nBrig. Gen. James Leo Dalton II was the assistant commanding general of the 25th Division in the Philippines. The 25th Division was involved in fighting across the South Pacific but met its strongest resistance in one of its last battles, capturing the Balite Pass at the head of Cagayan Valley at Luzon in 1945. The 25th was in combat for a record 165 days and lost more men to combat than any other U.S. division at Luzon.\n\nColonel William Orlando Darby was the assistant commanding general of the 10th Mountain Division when it was conducting combat actions in Italy. Darby had been designated for deployment to Hawaii, but after the Japanese attack he was sent to the 34th Infantry Division instead. From there, he was able to get an assignment to the newly formed 10th Mountain Division and took to the stringent regime like a fish to water.\n\nDarby, who had led a contingent of U.S. Army Rangers during combat operations in Sicily and Italy, was killed by artillery fire on April 30, 1945, just a few days before V-E day. His name had already been submitted to President Harry S. Truman for promotion to brigadier general, and he received the promotion posthumously, three months after his 34th birthday. Darby was the only Army officer promoted posthumously to flag officer rank during the war.\n\nBrig. Gen. Claudius Miller Easley was the assistant commanding general of the 96th Infantry Division when it was activated in 1942. The 96th Infantry was one of the few U.S. divisions to have the same commander throughout its World War II actions. The division was shipped to the Pacific theater and made an assault landing on Okinawa on April 1, 1945. Two months later, after being slowed by heavy rain, the division resumed the offensive against weakening enemy resistance. Easley was wounded by a sniper during the Leyte campaign and was killed on June 19, 1945, just days before the end of the last ground battle and only a few months before the end of the war.\n\nBrig. Gen. Charles L. Keerans, Jr. was the assistant commander of the 82nd Airborne Division. His death was one of the oddest to occur during the war. In 1943 the 82nd had prepared to make a night combat jump into the area around the Gulf of Gela, on the western coast of Italy. The effort was plagued with problems, including several American transport planes being shot down by friendly fire. Keerans\u2019 plane was one of those hit by friendly fire, but the pilot was able to crash land the plane in the water, 400 yards off shore. Keerans survived the crash and the next morning chatted with a sergeant from another unit and asked the sergeant to accompany him inland. The sergeant said that he wanted to return to his outfit and left. Keerans went inland by himself and was never seen again. For several years the army assumed he had been killed during the ditching of the aircraft, but the sergeant\u2019s story provided a different interpretation and the general was simply listed as killed in action, although his body was never found.",

         "title":"Hitler's War: How an Elite Branch of the Luftwaffe Set the City Ablaze",
         "Prediction_result":1,
         "content":"The bombers seemed to arrive overhead with much less warning than on any past air raid. Olive Bayliss, who lived with her family over at London Wall, in London\u2019s City District, was certain that the Luftwaffe came in faster than usual tonight, catching everyone by surprise.\n\nOlive\u2019s father, an air raid warden, lost no time in evacuating everyone from the flat when the first fire bombs clattered on the roof, which was the first indication that there was an air raid that night, December 29, 1940. Before going down to the air raid shelter, Mr. Bayliss climbed up on the roof to extinguish the fire bombs that had landed.\n\nAt Fighter Command Headquarters in Stanmore, Middlesex, the incoming raid was no surprise\u2013\u2013the staff of the headquarters\u2019 Filter Room had been tracking the enemy bombers for about an hour.\n\nAt about 5:15 pm, one of the blue-uniformed WAAFs on duty received a telephone call from Ventnor radar station on the Isle of Wight: \u201cHello, Stanmore,\u201d the voice of another WAAF coolly reported, \u201cI have a plot of five-plus hostiles.\u201d Five plus soon became 10 plus and, as the German bombers came into range one by one, finally reached a total of 20.\n\nThe 20 incoming bombers were the Heinkel He-111s of Kampfgruppe 100, which\n\nhad taken off from the Luftwaffe airfield at Vannes, Brittany, at 5:30 pm (4:30 pm\n\nLondon time).\n\nKampfgruppe 100 was an elite pathfinder wing, staffed entirely by handpicked pilots and aircrew. Their job was to drop thousands of fire bombs on the assigned target at the beginning of an air raid, creating a prominent bull\u2019s eye for the rest of the bomber fleet.\n\nNicknamed \u201cthe Fire Raisers,\u201d Kampfgruppe 100 was well known for having the best pilots and crews in the Luftwaffe. The unit\u2019s commander, veteran pilot Hauptmann Friedrich Ashenbrenner, had flown numerous bombing missions over England since September 1940, when the Blitz against London began.\n\nKG 100\u2019s special He-111 H2s were equipped with a device known as the \u201cX-apparatus,\u201d which allowed the navigator to find his target on even the darkest or foggiest of nights. It was an invaluable, although not altogether foolproof, aid to navigation.\n\nThe X-apparatus picked up a radio beam that was transmitted by a Luftwaffe Signal Corps station on the Normandy coast. This beam, the \u201cprimary beam,\u201d was aimed so that it would pass directly over the assigned target. The He-111 would simply fly along the primary beam all the way to the target.\n\nThis primary beam was intersected by two secondary beams that crossed the \u201cX.\u201d When Aschenbrenner\u2019s bomber crossed the first intersecting beam, the \u201cadvance signal,\u201d this indicated that he was about 10 miles from the target. Crossing the second beam, the \u201cmain signal,\u201d prompted the bomb aimer to toggle his load of incendiary bombs.\n\nThe first time that Hauptmann Aschenbrenner and KG 100 had used the X-apparatus had been against Coventry on the night of November 14. That night\u2019s raid had been one of the most destructive attacks in the Blitz against Britain. Following the Coventry raid, the German Propaganda Ministry coined the word \u201cCoventrized,\u201d meaning \u201cburned to the ground\u201d or \u201cobliterated.\u201d\n\nOn this Sunday afternoon, Aschenbrenner received orders that tonight\u2019s objective would be London. Once again, he and his Gruppe would spearhead the attack. KG 100\u2019s He-111s would go in low and fast to light up the target area with incendiaries.\n\nThe objective within \u201cLoge,\u201d the code word for London, would be the City of London. The City District, with its hodgepodge of old buildings, packed with textiles, books, and other highly flammable goods, was tailor made for Aschenbrenner\u2019s \u201cFire Raisers.\u201d Old-time London firemen called these buildings \u201ctorches looking for a light.\u201d\n\nAt St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, about a mile from Olive Bayliss\u2019s flat, one of the men on roof patrol telephoned the cathedral\u2019s control center at 6:05 pm to report that air-raid sirens were sounding out to the southwest.\n\nGeorge Garwood, a member of the Cathedral watch, received the call and told the patrol that he would be right up. But before Garwood could put on his ax belt and helmet, the roof patrolman telephoned again\u2014he could see incendiary bombs falling just across the river in Southwark. By the time Garwood reached the roof, the local sirens were sounding, and fire bombs were dropping on the cathedral itself.\n\nHauptmann Aschenbrenner had missed his target, the City of London, by about 1,000 yards. This was actually good bombing, considering the fact that he could not even see the ground because of the ten-tenths cloud cover. The other 19 Heinkels came in right behind him. Every one of them put their incendiaries right on target, which was the immediate vicinity of St. Paul\u2019s.\n\nNot every bomb posed a threat. Some failed to ignite, hitting the pavement with a loud, metallic crack. Five bombs landed on the newspaper offices of Bouverie House on Fleet Street. Of the five, one did not explode, one burned itself out on the concrete roof, and the other three were extinguished by the night watchman.\n\nThe incendiary bomb\u2014frequently abbreviated as \u201cIB\u201d\u2014was small, cheap to manufacture, and very effective. It measured about a foot in length, about three inches in diameter, and weighed one kilogram (2.2 pounds).\n\nWhen an IB landed on a roof or struck the pavement, its magnesium core burst into life, throwing white-hot splinters in a diameter of about 10 feet. It stopped sputtering after about a minute and began glowing intently at about 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes. During the first minute, a sandbag or a shovel full of earth would very quickly snuff it out.\n\nAlthough the IB was not the most sophisticated of weapons\u2014a London Fire Brigade officer called it \u201cnot a very clever bomb\u201d\u2014its small size was its greatest advantage. The bombs were packed into cylindrical containers called \u201cMolotov Breadbaskets,\u201d with 36 bombs in each container. Each of KG 100\u2019s He-111s carried five of these containers, which totaled 180 fire bombs. After being released, each breadbasket burst open at a preset altitude, spilling its contents over a confined area.\n\nOn the previous Sunday, December 22, the Luftwaffe introduced a new tactic: the fire blitz. The Luftwaffe set out to destroy the city of Manchester by dropping only incendiaries, thousands of them, and had largely succeeded. Whole sections of the city were burned out, reduced to street upon street of smoldering buildings by daybreak.\n\nBecause the Manchester fire raid had been so successful, Generalfeldmarschall Hugo Sperrle, commander of Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet Three), suggested that a full-scale incendiary raid be directed against London. Sperrle\u2019s suggestion was approved by Adolf Hitler, and the raid was planned and put in motion from Sperrle\u2019s headquarters in the Hotel Luxembourg in Paris.\n\nWith a bit of luck and the help of a slight northeasterly wind, the crews of KG 100 managed to start several fires within a short time. None of the crews knew exactly where their bombs were going any more than Hauptmann Aschenbrenner did because of the dense cloud cover. They just unloaded their bombs where the X-beams crossed.\n\nThe fire bombs of KG 100 did their job with frightening efficiency, punching or burning their way through roofs to start hundreds of fires. Several thousand feet above the clouds that covered London, Aschenbrenner could see the glow of the fires through the overcast. His men had done their job, creating a target, an aiming point for the rest of the Luftwaffe\u2019s bombers.\n\nAs Aschenbrenner and the rest of KG 100 turned for home, the bombers of Sperrle\u2019s Luftflotte 3 arrived over the target. These aircrews could also see the reddish patch in the clouds and dropped their bombloads on this vivid aiming point. With each new load of incendiaries, punctuated by the occasional 550-pound high-explosive bomb, the fires within the City grew both in size and intensity.\n\nBy 7 pm, 55 minutes after KG 100 arrived over the City, three separate fire zones had broken out. The largest, nearly three-quarters of a mile long and a quarter-mile wide, surrounded St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\n\nAlthough the City District is well known for its old churches and other quaint old places, it also had more than its share of military targets\u2014all rated top priority by the Luftwaffe. The Wood Street Telephone Exchange and the London Telephone Service, with their vitally important overseas communications lines, along with the General Post Office telephone and telegraph services, were important enough to rate pinpoint attacks as separate targets. The district\u2019s six rail stations had also been earmarked as critical, along with all the bridges crossing the River Thames.\n\nThe Central Telephone Exchange was one of the first of these essential targets to be destroyed. From the roof of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, George Garwood watched as it burned down \u201cwithout a bucket of water to put on it.\u201d\n\nLack of water was a major problem for the London Fire Brigade (LFB) that night. All of Western Europe was experiencing abnormally low tides on the night of December 29, including the Thames River Valley. Because of these unusually low tides, the Thames was reduced to a small, narrow stream, making it just about useless to the LFB as a source of water.\n\nTo make matters even worse, one of the few high-explosive bombs dropped so far had cracked the City\u2019s primary water main somewhere along its two-mile length. So many fire appliances\u2014the Fire Brigade\u2019s term for fire engines\u2014were linked up to the existing mains that water pressure dropped to zero. With the City main fractured, the smaller mains tapped dry, and the Thames all but dried up by the low tide, the expanding fire zone within the City was cut off from its water resources.\n\nEverything, every street and every building to the north and northeast of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, would burn in one vast fire\u2014one fireman called it the \u201cbiggest funeral pyre in the world\u201d\u2014until the area finally burned itself out. Once in a while, the wall of a fire-weakened building would flame up suddenly before crashing down into the street with a deafening roar.\n\nPaternoster Square, the home of London\u2019s publishing industry with over five million books in its warehouses, was going up in a brilliant, colossal bonfire. Only St. Paul\u2019s itself was not on fire, but it looked like it would be only a matter of time before architect Christopher Wren\u2019s venerable old structure (opened in 1708) would be burning along with its neighbors.\n\nThe fire-watching crew at the Daily Telegraph building on Fleet Street had a full view of St. Paul\u2019s from the west and reported that a steady hail of bombs had bounced off the Cathedral\u2019s huge dome during the first half hour of the raid.\n\nThus far, the Cathedral Watch had managed to deal with every incendiary before it could do any damage, but the crew could not reach every bomb as soon as it fell. At 6:39, the Control Centre received a telephone call from Cannon Street Fire Station. The firehouse switchboard reported that the dome of St. Paul\u2019s was on fire.\n\nAt the cathedral, the fire watch discovered that an incendiary had punched halfway through the dome\u2019s outer lead covering. The bomb was going to be a bit awkward to get at in spite of the fact that its tail fins were jutting through the outside of the dome, but it did not seem to pose anything resembling a serious threat.\n\nFrom the street, however, it looked as though the dome was burning. The brilliant white light of the sputtering bomb gave the impression that a major fire had taken hold. It was nothing but an illusion, but it was a convincing illusion.\n\nIn a nearby street, American radio correspondent Edward R. Murrow of the Columbia Broadcasting System had already given up all hope that the cathedral could be saved. \u201cTonight, the bomber planes of the German Third Reich hit London where it hurts the most\u2014in the heart.\u201d Murrow was making his nightly report to New York.\n\n\u201cAnd the church that meant most to Londoners is gone. St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, built by Sir Christopher Wren, her great dome towering over the capital of the Empire, is burning to the ground as I talk to you now.\u201d\n\nWhile Murrow was making his broadcast, members of the Cathedral Watch were slowly making their way toward the bomb. When it stopped sputtering and began glowing at 4,000 degrees, its molten core melted the dome\u2019s lead skin that held it in place.\n\nBefore anyone could get near it, the bomb fell outward, slid down the outside of the dome, and landed in the Stone Gallery, the walkway that circles the bottom of the dome, where it was easily disposed of. At the time, this was referred to as the \u201cMiracle of St. Paul\u2019s.\u201d Cynics have insisted that it was only gravity.\n\nNo one in the fire zone was given any time to catch their breath. Not many fire spotters were on duty on this Sunday night, but the few who were on hand were busy. New clusters of bombs kept falling, landing with their dazzling white sparklers. The fire crews put them out by dropping sand bags on them, just as the St. Paul\u2019s watch had done.\n\nThe firewatchers at the Guildhall, which might be described as the City\u2019s town hall, had done a successful job of saving their building from serious damage. The 15th-century building was surrounded by collapsing, fire-ruined buildings but was still untouched by flames itself.\n\nFirewatcher R.C.M. Fitzhugh gave this impression of the view from the Guildhall roof: \u201cThe block bounded by Bassishaw House, Fore Street, Aldermanbury, and Basinghall Street appeared to be one solid mass of flame,\u201d he wrote in his diary. \u201cSt. Stephen\u2019s, Coleman Street, was soon enveloped in flames, and we could see the steeple and weather cock fall. Fires were everywhere in the City area.\n\n\u201cFrom time to time, heavy high-explosive bombs or land mines were dropped\u2026. There would be the sound of something rushing through the air, then a brilliant flash would light up the entire sky and horizon and followed within two or three seconds by the most resounding explosion.\u201d\n\nThe Guildhall roof spotters knew more about the state of the City\u2019s fires than the commander of Luftflotte 3. In his suite at the Hotel Luxembourg in Paris, Feldmarschall Sperrle did not have an accurate idea of the damage that was being done by his bombers. He had been receiving reports that the target was coming under constant attack and that it had been set brilliantly on fire by KG 100. But because of the cloud cover over London, these visual reports from his bomber crews were not precise.\n\nEven so, Sperrle had every reason to be optimistic. He was planning a second attack, another wave of bombers that would drop high explosives on the target area, which would finish off anything left standing. Sperrle was as concerned with the weather report as he was the bombing results. The heavy overcast that covered southern England was threatening to turn into a rain storm, which might well force him to cancel the second attack.\n\nFor Luftflotte 3\u2019s bomber crews, the night\u2019s attack was turning out to be much easier than anyone expected. The target area, all lit up and visible from the Channel coast, would have been difficult not to hit.\n\nAntiaircraft fire was sporadic\u2014once in a while, some antiaircraft shells would pop through the overcast and burst a safe distance away\u2014and were usually not accurate. The German air crews kept their eyes open for the RAF\u2019s night fighters, but there had not been any sign of them so far.\n\nIt was satisfying to know that all their bombs were landing on target. On some raids nobody could be absolutely certain if they were bombing their objective or some vacant field miles away, but not tonight. The only real problem, and this was minor, was with the turbulence from the fires. Flying over the rising hot air lifted the bombers upward for several hundred feet, but this did not interfere with bombing accuracy.\n\nAnd the bombing continued to be extremely accurate. Besides vital communications links like the Central Telephone Exchange and the General Post Office, Sperrle\u2019s transportation objectives were also being hit hard. No trains were running within several miles of Central London. Cannon Street rail station and London Bridge Station were both on fire, along with Waterloo Station, which was actually out of the fire zone, and Fenchurch Street Station was shut down because of damaged signals and blocked tracks.\n\nGuildhall\u2019s communication center received a priority telephone message from Prime Minister Winston Churchill sometime before 7 pm\u2014St. Paul\u2019s must be saved at all costs. Churchill\u2019s communiqu\u00e9 was passed directly to the control center at St. Paul\u2019s, but it had little effect. Although Churchill\u2019s message was both welcome and appreciated, there was not much else for the Cathedral Watch to do that had not already been done.\n\nCivilian fire spotters frequently spelled the difference between survival and disaster, not only at St. Paul\u2019s and Guildhall but at office blocks and buildings throughout the City. But sometimes even the best intentions and efforts of the fire-watching crews were not quite enough. The fire-watching team at a Building Society on Ludgate Hill, just a short walk from St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, managed to put out every fire bomb that landed on their roof.\n\nBut the building\u2019s waterproof paper window panes, which replaced the glass panes that had been blown out in an earlier air raid, had been set on fire by flames from the building next door. Burning embers managed to find their way through these vacant windows, where they started small fires inside the Building Society\u2019s offices. It did not take long before an entire section of the building was burning. The fire was obviously more than two volunteer fire crews could deal with, so the men sent for the Fire Brigade.\n\nWhen the fire engines stopped in front of the Building Society, the firemen stepped off the machines to take a good look at the fire. They stood in the street for a minute or so, gazing up with clinical detachment. Finally, one of the firemen spoke up: \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly big enough yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back later.\u201d\n\nWith that, the entire crew climbed back aboard their fire engine and drove off, giving the Building Society\u2019s fire watchers their last glimpse of the London Fire Brigade for the rest of the night.\n\nSome people tried to carry on with their everyday routine in spite of the air raid, which sometimes brought them closer to disaster than they realized. At 7:30, a milk-tank driver left Hounslow, Middlesex, for his nightly run through London to Bow, East London, which would take him right through the City. When he reached the vicinity of Blackfriars Bridge, about a quarter-mile southwest of St. Paul\u2019s, just about everything in front of him was a solid wall of fire.\n\nHe always drove this route, straight along Queen Victoria Street, and could see that the street was lined with burning buildings. But the driver was not about to let anything as trivial as an air raid change his usual route. He put his rig in gear and headed eastward, right up Queen Victoria Street.\n\nHe had not gone far when a policeman stopped him and asked him exactly where he thought he was going. The driver matter-of-factly answered, \u201cBow\u201d\u2013\u2013to East London directly through the fire zone.\n\n\u201cNot through here, you\u2019re not,\u201d the policeman declared and pointed in the direction of Mansion House, the Lord Mayor\u2019s official residence. \u201cLook at that!\u201d\n\nThe driver looked and saw the fa\u00e7ade of a fire-weakened building crash down into the street. If the policeman had not stopped him, the milk-tank driver estimated that he would have been passing that building when it collapsed.\n\nOne of the leading topics of conversation throughout London was the possibility of a follow-up raid by the Luftwaffe. Everyone remembered the first air raid on London, which took place on September 7/8, 1940, when bombers returned to drop high explosives on the fires that had been started earlier. It seemed more than a good possibility that the same thing would happen tonight; the City\u2019s fires certainly offered a tempting enough target.\n\nFeldmarschall Sperrle still had his second wave scheduled, even though he was receiving nothing but bad weather reports from his bomber bases. Every one of Luftflotte 3\u2019s airfields reported deteriorating weather conditions\u2014it was also raining in Paris\u2014and staff meteorologists were predicting that the rain would continue for at least another 24 hours.\n\nBut reports of the attack on London were positive and encouraging\u2014just about every dispatch mentioned vivid fires burning in the target area\u2014and Sperrle was unwilling to cancel the second attack. His second wave of bombers, carrying loads of high explosives instead of incendiaries, would be able to inflict maximum damage on the target area.\n\nBecause of the weather, Sperrle decided that it might be a good idea to postpone the second strike for a few hours. A short rollback might give the weather a chance to improve, in spite of what the weather experts were predicting, and would still allow his bomber units to drop their bombs under cover of darkness. Luftflotte 3 would still have its unmissable aiming point along with better weather if all went well. The order went out to all airfields: stand down until further instructions.\n\nMore than 1,400 fires were burning in and around the City. All over London people were stopping whatever they were doing and going outside for a better look. A woman who lived in Chelsea, several miles west of the fire zone, went up on her roof to check on the fires. She could clearly see the dome of St. Paul\u2019s silhouetted against the glare. The sky was incandescent with red and orange that seemed to tower miles in the air. She was certain that this was the last she would ever see of St. Paul\u2019s.\n\nBy this time Guildhall had finally succumbed to the surrounding fires. Blazing bits of ash from the church of St. Lawrence Jewry, which was only a few feet away and had been burning for well over an hour, had started fires in the hall\u2019s wooden roofing beams. High winds fanned the flames, blowing them into other parts of the Guildhall complex. The Fire Brigade came, but there was not much it could do. One of the fireman told RCM Fitzhugh that his men had been ready for the past 15 minutes but there was no water.\n\nBy 9:50, the fires were out of control. The noise from the wind-driven flames and the crackle of burning beams and roof timbers was loud enough to drown out the shouting of the firemen who were standing in the street with dry firehoses. Telephone operators in the control center stayed on the job even though the exchange lines were dying one at a time.\n\nGuildhall\u2019s logbook gives a cryptic account of the City\u2019s ordeal on this night. Each entry gives the time and nature of each incident. (\u201cIB \u2013 F\u201d signifies \u201cIncendiary Bomb \u2013 Fire.\u201d)\n\nCall:No. 16.20Knightrider Street \u2013 Queen Victoria StreetIB \u2013 F\n\nNo. 596.45Eastcheap by Mark Lane. \u201cExplosive IBs IB \u2013 F\n\nare bursting all over the place.\u201d\n\nNo. 626.59Queen Victoria Street by Mark LaneIB \u2013 F\n\n\u201cWell alight.\u201d\n\nNo. 74b8.10YMCA Building, 186 Aldersgate St. IB \u2013 F\n\n\u201cFire spreading rapidly \u2013 Nobody in Building.\u201d\n\nNo. 1379.1026/27 Bush Lane \u2013 \u201cLFB wanted urgently.\u201dIB \u2013 F\n\nNo. 17110.0012/16 Red Lion Court \u201cLFS in attendance, IB \u2013 F\n\nbut no water.\u201d\n\nThe telephone operators received reports of only a fraction of the more than 1,400 fires in and around the City. This was partly because Guildhall\u2019s telephones were swamped by incoming calls, but mostly because there were so few people in the City on this Sunday night. There was no one on hand to report the outbreaks.\n\nBy 11:30, it was obvious that Guildhall would have to be evacuated. By this time there was only one telephone line still in operation. The officer in charge told the operators to leave the building since there was nothing else for them to do.\n\nWhile Guildhall\u2019s telephone operators were leaving the building, the tide began to come in. Water was now being relayed from the Thames, via 31/2-inch fire hoses into the 5,000-gallon dams that had been installed throughout the district. It was only a trickle, but a critical trickle. A few hours earlier and it might have made all the difference.\n\nFirefighting units were also arriving in the City fire zone from all over the greater London area as well as throughout the Home Counties. They were too late to do anything about the fire damage that had already occurred, but at least they would have some water to help keep the fires from spreading.\n\nA total of 183 bomb incidents had been logged by Guildhall\u2019s telephone operators beginning at 6:20\u201429 of these had been high-explosive bombs. The operators kept taking reports right through the air raid until around midnight.\n\nShortly before the evacuation order was issued, a call came through to report that Number 5 Creed Lane had been hit by an incendiary. This was no different from any of the other calls that had jammed the exchange lines during the past 51/2 hours, except that this was the last one for the night. The time was 11:40.\n\nAt Fighter Command Headquarters in Stanmore, Middlesex, the ritual of plotting and tracking the enemy bombers also continued throughout the night. The atmosphere inside the Operations Room remained quiet and tense as the WAAFs mechanically repeated the height and range of the bombers on the huge table map. For the past hour or so they had been moving steadily southward, away from London.\n\nFrom their overhead gallery, the Operations staff watched as the red arrows retreated toward the south\u2013\u2013across Surrey and Kent and Sussex to the Channel. As the bombers crossed the Channel and made their way back to their bases in France, the arrows were removed from the map, one by one, until the map was clear of all enemy aircraft. The Luftwaffe might be back later, but for the first time since 6 pm the dark area on the map that represented London was free of the red markers.\n\nNo one in London had any idea that the air raid was over, not even anyone within the City fire zone. The antiaircraft guns had gone silent, but that was no indication of anything\u2013\u2013there had been lulls in the shooting throughout the attack.\n\nThe firemen and roof spotters were surrounded by their own world of noise and fire. The fires themselves rolled like a thunderstorm, and more than 2,000 pumps made their own kind of thunder. Many had not been able to hear the bombers for the past few hours, so they could not possibly know that the planes were gone.\n\nTen minutes after the Creed Lane bomb incident had been logged, the all clear sounded. The high-pitched howl of the air raid sirens flooded the blacked-out streets all over London. The sirens even penetrated the interiors of air raid shelters throughout the area, where they produced a collective sigh of relief.\n\nThere were some who could not bring themselves to believe that it was all over. One auxiliary fireman was taken completely by surprise when he heard the sirens. \u201cI immediately thought the authorities were sending an unprecedented second alert, in a desperate attempt to warn us of some new menace,\u201d he said. \u201cI frantically tried to think what it could be\u2014we already had rattles for gas and church bells for invasion.\u201d\n\nWhen the sirens held the high note, signalling the all clear, the fireman was absolutely incredulous. \u201cThe crazy thought even crossed my mind that Fifth Columnists had somehow managed to give a false All Clear. It was simply unbelievable that the Germans would miss the juiciest target in history\u2014and how could our people be so sure that they were not coming back?\u201d\n\nSome of the Guildhall volunteers decided to stay inside the building when the evacuation order was given. They went to work salvaging some of the library\u2019s centuries-old books and documents. After they finished, most of them straggled over to the pubic air raid shelter on nearby Basinghall Street to get some much needed sleep.\n\nA few of the volunteers went out to look for something to eat, maybe a sandwich and a cup of tea at an all-night caf\u00e9. While he was walking through the district, RCM Fitzhugh noticed that it was beginning to rain.\n\nFeldmarschall Sperrle realized that he did not have any other choice. It had been raining for several hours in Paris, and the weather experts were predicting no let-up in sight. Almost every one of Luftflotte 3\u2019s airfields had reported that they were completely shut down with unusable runways that were choked with mud. From his suite in the Hotel Luxembourg on Paris\u2019 Left Bank, Sperrle finally canceled the second attack.\n\nIt had been a reluctant decision, and Sperrle had taken several hours to make it. The first wave had set the target well alight, and the target area was more than ripe for a second attack. But a second strike was clearly out of the question; one bomber had already crashed while trying to land at Orly Field. If Sperrle went ahead with his original plan, he knew that he would almost certainly lose many more aircraft.\n\nThere was no use brooding about it; there was nothing anybody could do about the weather. Sperrle issued the necessary instructions to his staff officers, who began relaying the stand down orders by telephone. Since there was nothing else to be accomplished, Sperrle said good night to his staff and went to bed.\n\nThe all clear did not mean much to the firemen on duty in the City. Their night would not come to an end for several more hours. Fires were still out of control but were no longer spreading as quickly as before; the linkup from the Thames was making it possible for the fire services to begin holding the flames back.\n\nThere was no let-up for most of the fireman\u2014only hour after hour of holding a pressurized firehose in sweltering heat and stinging smoke. The sun had come up by 7 am, but because of the drizzle and the overcast sky it was hidden from view. However, the water relay from the Thames was now having its full effect, and the fire crews were finally able to do more than just watch while the City burned down around them. By 7:30, the fires had been contained.\n\nThe new day also brought another working Monday for Londoners. In a few hours, shops and offices within the City, as well as throughout London, would be opening for business\u2014at least the businesses that were still standing.\n\nThe air raid did not stop Londoners from going to work. During the September to November air raids, when the Luftwaffe bombed London every night for 57 consecutive nights, the morning after each attack saw workers making their way around bomb damage and cratered roads to get to their jobs. This particular morning, after the great fire raid, was no different.\n\nLondoners had learned that the morning after an air raid meant chaotic traffic and that it was best to leave for work much earlier than usual. Today, even an early start was not much help. Every road into the City, along with all four Thames bridges, was closed to automobile traffic. London Transport issued an official report on the traffic situation which began with this comically understated appraisal: \u201cAs a result of the intense attack last night, traffic conditions in the Central London area are bad.\u201d\n\nTraveling by train did not offer much of an improvement. All but one of the City\u2019s rail stations was closed. The official notice that greeted passengers on this Monday morning read, \u201cDue To Enemy Action Trains Will Be Subject To Delay.\u201d\n\nMost people who worked in the City rode their usual trains or buses as far as they could and walked the rest of the way. Many walked for a mile or more over rubble and leaky firehoses and arrived at their offices wet and grimy. Clerks and secretaries often arrived hours late and were congratulated for having shown up at all.\n\nAfter making their way around roadblocks and through police lines, thousands arrived at work only to find that their offices or factories had disappeared during the night. Hundreds of firms had been destroyed; businesses that had taken a lifetime to build up were gone.\n\nDisplaced workers simply wandered aimlessly about, not knowing what else to do. A crowd gathered outside St. Paul\u2019s, as though hoping that some of the cathedral\u2019s charm might rub off on them. St. Paul\u2019s became a symbol of London\u2019s defiance in the Blitz.\n\nA damaging blow had been dealt to the business heart of London, along with its essential war services\u2014transportation and communications facilities. The Post Office Telephones on King Edward Street were a total loss; the building itself had been completely burned out, and the basement with all of its transformers was flooded. The Central Exchange on Wood Street had also been completely destroyed along with every other building on both sides of the street.\n\nFeldmarschall Sperrle was thoroughly disappointed that he had had to call off his second strike. The rotten weather had just been bad luck. He hated to give up the opportunity to follow up his fire raid with an all-out high-explosive attack. As far as Sperrle was concerned, only half an air raid had taken place the previous night.\n\nHe had no real idea of the damage that his bombers had inflicted. Bomber crews only mentioned \u201csehr starke Br\u00e4nde\u201d\u2014very fierce fires\u2014in the target area, and reconnaissance aircraft had not been able to photograph the target because London was still covered by a solid layer of cloud.\n\nAn official report gives evidence of the Luftwaffe\u2019s lack of detailed information. \u201cToward the end of the attack,\u201d the report states, \u201cthere were over 100 widely spread fires with dense, black smoke, mainly in the City and to the north.\u201d Actually, more than 1,500 fires resulted from the incendiary bombs alone, with even more damage resulting from the strong wind.\n\nGerman Propaganda Minister Dr. Josef Goebbels shared Sperrle\u2019s opinion. If Goebbels had known about the chaos caused by the raid, he would have issued one of his usual long-winded descriptions of the attack. Instead, only a routine communiqu\u00e9 was issued on December 30: \u201cStrong bomber forces attacked London again last night.\u201d\n\nWithin the next few days, German intelligence would learn all about the full effect of the fire raid, and the Propaganda Ministry would jump into full gear. Among other things, Goebbels\u2019 department would claim that 100,000 incendiaries were dropped. Actually, about 24,000 were dropped.\n\nBut for now, the propagandists did not even bother with the usual practice of interviewing bomber crews. Because the second strike had been canceled, the raid was not considered important enough.\n\nThe center of the City\u2019s fire damage was in the area to the north and northeast of St. Paul\u2019s. Almost every building within this district had been destroyed, with row upon row of free-standing walls and fire-blackened ruins creaking in the wind. Hundreds of foot-long IBs had burned themselves out on the pavement, leaving indelible marks on the concrete. These splotches reminded New York Times reporter Raymond Daniell of chewing gum on a New York City sidewalk.\n\nOne of the few buildings to survive the fire storm was\u2014the height of irony\u2014Redcross Street Fire Station. The firehouse was certainly charred from the surrounding buildings, but it remained in service. After the Royal Engineers pulled down the nearby fire-weakened buildings, the firemen and firewomen would plant a thriving vegetable and flower garden, which included apple trees.\n\nBy mid-morning, the fire services were being sent home in increasing numbers. Some had been tending fires for more than 14 hours without even a chance to sit down. One at a time, the trailer pumps, turntable ladders, and heavy units, all manned by bone-weary and indescribably filthy firemen, left the fire zone and headed for their home stations.\n\nSometimes there was a small surprise to hurry the departing firemen on their way. At Tower Pier, just adjacent to the Tower of London and about a half mile from St. Paul\u2019s, Fireman L.P. Andrews and his crew had been pumping water from their fireboat into the fire zone since the small hours. Sometime during the late morning, the fireboat was approached by a naval launch. An officer on board the launch hailed the firemen: \u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d\n\n\u201cPumping water,\u201d Andrews shouted back.\n\n\u201cWhat time did you arrive?\u201d the launch persisted.\n\n\u201cAbout 2:30.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas there anyone here when you arrived?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you better get the hell out of it. I evacuated this area at about 1:30. You are probably about 20 feet off a parachute bomb.\u201d\n\nA parachute bomb, also known as a land mine, was a cylinder containing about 1,500 pounds of high explosives. It came down by parachute and was capable of doing an enormous amount of damage. An exploding land mine could wipe out an entire row of houses or level the better part of a city block and still have enough punch to shatter windows two or three streets away.\n\nThe fireboat\u2019s crew immediately stopped the pumps, disconnected the hoses, let go the ropes, and let the current take them well clear of the area before starting their engines for their trip back to their base at Tilbury, Essex.\n\nNobody in London or anywhere else was able to find out much about the air raid from official news sources. Wartime censorship and security stopped the release of any specific facts or of any useful information at all.\n\nA bus driver from the Paddington section of London made this note in his diary: \u201cI cannot find out much about last night\u2019s fire \u2026 the 6 pm news tells us [only of] the wilful firing of the City of London and severe damage.\u201d\n\nThe newspapers did not give out much information either. Monday\u2019s \u201cLate London\u201d edition of The Times featured this two-column headline on page four:\n\nFIRE BOMBS RAINED ON LONDON: MANY BUILDINGS HIT\n\nThe story beneath was as dim as the headline. Strict wartime censorship prevented editors from printing a more extensive report. It was better to run a vague, noninformative story than to be charged with supplying \u201cinformation of value to the enemy.\u201d\n\nMost of the regulars and auxiliaries of the London Fire Brigade returned to their usual sweep-and-polish routine almost as soon as they arrived back at their stations.\n\nRedcross Street Fire Station, which had been abandoned at the height of the fires, was soon back in operation. When Fireman James Goldsmith returned to the station, he began cleaning and sorting his gear just in case of another call. Equipment and lengths of hose would sometimes be lost during a fire, which usually presented a problem. But today there was plenty of gear lying about right on the street.\n\nNearby Whitecross Street was littered with several burned-out and abandoned trailer pumps complete with all their tools and equipment. The hardware only had to be picked up and carried off.\n\nThe great fire raid was over, but the Blitz against London would not end for another 41/2 months. Feldmarschall Sperrle\u2019s bombers would attack London again between mid-January and mid-March 1941, but these were mainly small nuisance raids.\n\nThe big raids began again in March 1941 and continued throughout April on the basis of roughly one raid per week. Two major raids would take place in April, which would be remembered by Londoners as \u201cThe Wednesday\u201d and \u201cThe Saturday,\u201d April 16 and 19, both of which were triggered in retaliation for an RAF raid on Berlin.\n\nThe last Blitz raid before Hitler invaded Russia in June would come on the night of May 10/11, 1941. To many Londoners, this was the worst of all. For 61/2 hours Sperrle\u2019s bombers dumped their incendiaries and high explosives on London. When the attack finally ended, rail and transportation centers had been seriously disrupted, and thousands of houses and factories were destroyed.\n\nWestminster Abbey, the Tower of London, the British Museum, and many other famous landmarks had been bombed but had not been destroyed. More than 1,400 Londoners had been killed, and another 1,800 were wounded.\n\nGermany would not be immune to bombing as the war went on. Just as London had suffered as severely as Warsaw and Rotterdam earlier in the war, cities within the greater German Reich would feel the brunt of bigger and better armed Allied bombers. One thousand bombers would attack Cologne on the night of May 30, 1942. Throughout the war just about every major city in Germany\u2014Dresden, Hamburg, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Leipzig, and Berlin\u2014would be bombed relentlessly by the RAF at night and the U.S. Eighth Air Force by day.\n\nThe same fireman who had been alarmed when the sirens sounded an early all clear on the night of December 29 was stationed in Germany after the war. He had a firsthand look at the terrible destruction that had been inflicted and was moved to comment, \u201cChrist, we never knew what bombing was.\u201d\n\nThis was first published by the Warfare History Network.\n\nImage: Wikimedia",

Who protected MySpace when Facebook disrupted the first big social media site? Who protected AltaVista and HotBot, never mind Yahoo, when Google came on the scene? This is the ultimate in hubris.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t been paying attention, Apple wants to give you the opportunity to opt out of being tracked. But Facebook and Google make their money on selling ads, and by utilizing all the data you inadvertently provide, they allow advertisers to target very specific users, and charge more for this. The other day someone told me they were uptight about putting their birthday online. I hate to tell you, BUT THEY\u2019VE ALREADY GOT IT! They literally know where you live and what your interests are. And Google has your search history, yes, of all the porn sites you\u2019ve visited. And true, you can delete your Google search history, but they don\u2019t advertise this and they don\u2019t make it easy to do so, almost nobody does it.\n\nNow I go to too many sites that require a Facebook login before I can see the content, especially videos. What do I do? I PASS! I don\u2019t want to give Facebook any more data than they already have. And the only Facebook account I have is a fake one, which I barely use, but still I\u2019m served up ads based on where I\u2019ve surfed all over the web, even though I clicked on nothing on Facebook. Creepy. Come on, we\u2019ve all had this experience over the last decade\u2026HOW DO THEY KNOW?\n\nBut they do.\n\nThe backlash has begun, but only the business people and legislators have power. As for the public\u2026sure, people can boycott, but so far that has never ever worked, because Amazon is too efficient and trustworthy and you can\u2019t resist hanging with your friends on social media. As for getting rid of online shopping and social media\u2026while we\u2019re at it, why don\u2019t we get rid of airplanes and automobiles and mobile phones. Whenever you try to jet back to the past, it does not work, even though all the older intellectuals keep telling us to do so. But the joke is on them, because social discourse, the veritable pulse of society, lives online\u2026BUT AT WHAT COST?\n\nThe biggest question is content. Google serves up different results based on the same query and Facebook makes no effort to balance opinions. Zuckerberg says the platform is neutral, as he cozies up to Trump\u2026but it\u2019s not neutral when it comes to its business model! That\u2019s America, pure greed. You wonder why our country is in the crapper? Because no one is willing to sacrifice no one is willing to lose. No one is willing to make less money. No one is willing to give up their space at the elite institution. And if this doesn\u2019t make you hate coastal liberals, you are one, they\u2019re the worst offenders. Then again, in the heartland they don\u2019t believe in a social safety net, even though to the degree there is one, never mind the \u201cinvisible\u201d funding of works in their state, the money is provided by said coastal elites in those blue states. California has the biggest population, but the smallest voice per voter in the Senate. The right is winning with this and the Electoral College, yet it\u2019s the left\u2019s fault?\n\nBut on social media, you\u2019re in your silo, you click around and the site labels you and feeds you more of what you\u2019ve already seen, and tries to titillate and outrage you so you won\u2019t sign off as they feed you more ads.\n\nFacebook SEEMS free, but it\u2019s not. You\u2019re paying with your data, which is extremely valuable, for the privilege of access. It\u2019s almost like dope, they give you a hit and you can\u2019t resist, you get hooked. But if you had to pay for Facebook, how much is it worth, is it worth anything at all? Does Facebook have an inalienable right to have an ad-supported business?\n\nApple has a completely different philosophy. Apple sells hardware, and a few services, and respects your privacy. As for all those supposed hacks, the servers were solid, it\u2019s just that the users employed lame passwords. Yes, our idiot in chief used the password \u201cmaga2020,\u201d which is little better than \u201c1234,\u201d read about it here: bit.ly/2IVlwXa\n\nI pay a lot for my Apple products. For the very simple reason that as Steve Jobs said, they just work. Also, I know they\u2019re the most secure. Use an Android, never mind a PC, and you\u2019re inviting hackers in, you\u2019re inviting trouble. But, since Apple is high-priced, and its adherents are vocal, believers in the company\u2019s excellence, there\u2019s a backlash. People hate Apple because their phones are not customizable enough. Hell, do you want to customize your television, your automobile, and at what cost?\n\nSo Apple stands up for the little guy and\u2026\n\nCrickets. Because the majority uses Android. In handsets, not in dollars, Apple rules the app market.\n\nAnd if you follow Apple closely, the company was promoting this ability to decline trackability for months. They delayed it once, to allow Facebook time to adjust, but now Apple wants to turn it on in iOS14, which was released a few months back, and Facebook is APOPLECTIC!\n\nBut most people don\u2019t know, because they don\u2019t follow Apple news and they don\u2019t read the physical newspaper, where Facebook took out giant ads decrying the new Apple privacy process. Those ads are for legislators to see, business people, to wake them up, to get them motivated, to see which side they want to be on, to see who will pay them to be on either side. Facebook doesn\u2019t care about you and me, even though they\u2019re saying they do, because by tracking us they give us the \u201cprivilege\u201d of directly targeted ads. But anybody who thinks ads are a service online\u2026I haven\u2019t met anybody, except for those in the advertising business itself. I don\u2019t want to be followed around online by a product I clicked on once, that I\u2019ll never buy, OR ALREADY BOUGHT, for eternity. And you click on the blue button in the upper righthand corner but the truth is it doesn\u2019t work, the ads don\u2019t go away.\n\nMaybe you should have to pay for Facebook. That could kill the service, or it could improve it, then the user would be the customer as opposed to the advertiser.\n\nAnd if Facebook doesn\u2019t have your data\u2026it could lose a few bucks, and advertisers could have less targeted ads, but are both of these so critical that they must be supported by our government, written in stone?\n\nMeanwhile, the government is suing Facebook for antitrust. And Facebook\u2019s main complaint? You approved their acquisitions. There\u2019s no double jeopardy clause in business, this is not a criminal matter, then again maybe it should be, maybe Zuckerberg, et al, should be threatened with some jail time, they might clean up their act.\n\nAnd everyone knows the wankers in Congress, beholden to the money, don\u2019t understand technology anyway, they still have AOL e-mail addresses. And what happened to AOL? With its walled garden with ultimate access to the web? Its business model got undermined by high speed internet access provided by cable and phone companies. You didn\u2019t see AOL lobbying Congress to make dialup the norm, to hold back broadband. But that\u2019s essentially what Facebook wants here!\n\nAs for Apple\u2026 Have you used Sign in with Apple? Check it out: It\u2019s not on every site, but it does work on Reddit, why should I cough up all my info to Reddit, and I certainly don\u2019t want the site to know my interests. Facebook IS Big Brother. Zuckerberg knows more about the individual than the government, more than anybody in history, but Mark is crying and demanding no change, so he can continue to rape and pillage our society. Think about it\u2026 Fox News was bad enough, but once Facebook gained traction the country split into two silos, with two sets of \u201cfacts.\u201d Meanwhile, Facebook kept pouring gasoline on the conflagration, firing up users to hate others. This is the company we want to protect?\n\nI\u2019d love to tell you you have power. But really, this battle is being fought way above our heads. Then again, if everybody knew about it\u2026\n\nAs for paying for Facebook\u2026 Have you noticed you\u2019re paying for so much online these days? News\u2026 All the papers have paywalls, maybe soft, allowing you a certain number of articles for free, but if you want more you pay. And I pay for the \u201cNew York Times,\u201d the \u201cWashington Post,\u201d the \u201cWall Street Journal\u201d\u2026 AND I subscribe to Apple News+, for ten bucks a month I get even more, and a good chunk of revenue goes to the publications, as opposed to Google or Facebook which essentially steal it with impunity.\n\nOr else you download an app. Right up front it says you can pay with ads or you can pay for the no-ad version. And usually, the paid version has more capability. What\u2019s wrong with this business model?\n\nThe future is coming down the track, we cannot stop it, but we can guide it, we can influence it, we can try and steer it in the right direction. Also, if we see flaws after the fact we\u2019re allowed to fix them. BUT NOT FACEBOOK, Facebook is forever, it should be able to hoover up our info willy-nilly.\n\nHOGWASH!\n\n~~~\n\nVisit the archive: http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/\n\n\u2013\n\n@Lefsetz http://www.twitter.com/lefsetz\n\n\u2013\n\nIf you would like to subscribe to the LefsetzLetter",

         "title":"What \"Capitalism\" Really Means",
         "Prediction_result":1,
         "content":"Tags\n\n[Economic Policy: Thoughts for Today and Tomorrow (1979), lecture 1 (1958)]\n\nDescriptive terms which people use are often quite misleading. In talking about modern captains of industry and leaders of big business, for instance, they call a man a \"chocolate king\" or a \"cotton king\" or an \"automobile king.\" Their use of such terminology implies that they see practically no difference between the modern heads of industry and those feudal kings, dukes or lords of earlier days. But the difference is in fact very great, for a chocolate king does not rule at all; he serves. He does not reign over conquered territory, independent of the market, independent of his customers. The chocolate king\u2014or the steel king or the automobile king or any other king of modern industry\u2014depends on the industry he operates and on the customers he serves. This \"king\" must stay in the good graces of his subjects, the consumers; he loses his \"kingdom\" as soon as he is no longer in a position to give his customers better service and provide it at lower cost than others with whom he must compete.\n\nTwo hundred years ago, before the advent of capitalism, a man's social status was fixed from the beginning to the end of his life; he inherited it from his ancestors, and it never changed. If he was born poor, he always remained poor, and if he was born rich\u2014a lord or a duke\u2014he kept his dukedom and the property that went with it for the rest of his life.\n\nAs for manufacturing, the primitive processing industries of those days existed almost exclusively for the benefit of the wealthy. Most of the people (90 percent or more of the European population) worked the land and did not come in contact with the city-oriented processing industries. This rigid system of feudal society prevailed in the most developed areas of Europe for many hundreds of years.\n\nHowever, as the rural population expanded, there developed a surplus of people on the land. For this surplus of population without inherited land or estates, there was not enough to do, nor was it possible for them to work in the processing industries; the kings of the cities denied them access. The numbers of these \"outcasts\" continued to grow, and still no one knew what to do with them. They were, in the full sense of the word, \"proletarians,\" outcasts whom the government could only put into the workhouse or the poorhouse. In some sections of Europe, especially in the Netherlands and in England, they became so numerous that, by the 18th century, they were a real menace to the preservation of the prevailing social system.\n\nToday, in discussing similar conditions in places like India or other developing countries, we must not forget that, in 18th-century England, conditions were much worse. At that time, England had a population of 6 or 7 million people, but of those 6 or 7 million people, more than 1 million, probably 2 million, were simply poor outcasts for whom the existing social system made no provision. What to do with these outcasts was one of the great problems of 18th-century England.\n\nAnother great problem was the lack of raw materials. The British, very seriously, had to ask themselves this question: What are we going to do in the future, when our forests will no longer give us the wood we need for our industries and for heating our houses? For the ruling classes it was a desperate situation. The statesmen did not know what to do, and the ruling gentry were absolutely without any ideas on how to improve conditions.\n\nOut of this serious social situation emerged the beginnings of modern capitalism. There were some persons among those outcasts, among those poor people, who tried to organize others to set up small shops which could produce something. This was an innovation. These innovators did not produce expensive goods suitable only for the upper classes; they produced cheaper products for everyone's needs. And this was the origin of capitalism as it operates today. It was the beginning of mass production, the fundamental principle of capitalistic industry. Whereas the old processing industries serving the rich people in the cities had existed almost exclusively for the demands of the upper classes, the new capitalist industries began to produce things that could be purchased by the general population. It was mass production to satisfy the needs of the masses.\n\nThis is the fundamental principle of capitalism as it exists today in all of those countries in which there is a highly developed system of mass production: Big business, the target of the most fanatic attacks by the so-called leftists, produces almost exclusively to satisfy the wants of the masses. Enterprises producing luxury goods solely for the well-to-do can never attain the magnitude of big businesses. And today, it is the people who work in large factories who are the main consumers of the products made in those factories. This is the fundamental difference between the capitalistic principles of production and the feudalistic principles of the preceding ages.\n\nWhen people assume, or claim, that there is a difference between the producers and the consumers of the products of big businesses, they are badly mistaken. In American department stores you hear the slogan, \"the customer is always right.\" And this customer is the same man who produces in the factory those things which are sold in the department stores. The people who think that the power of big business is enormous are mistaken also, since big business depends entirely on the patronage of those who buy its products: the biggest enterprise loses its power and its influence when it loses its customers.\n\nFifty or 60 years ago it was said in almost all capitalist countries that the railroad companies were too big and too powerful; they had a monopoly; it was impossible to compete with them. It was alleged that, in the field of transportation, capitalism had already reached a stage at which it had destroyed itself, for it had eliminated competition. What people overlooked was the fact that the power of the railroads depended on their ability to serve people better than any other method of transportation. Of course it would have been ridiculous to compete with one of these big railroad companies by building another railroad parallel to the old line, since the old line was sufficient to serve existing needs. But very soon there came other competitors. Freedom of competition does not mean that you can succeed simply by imitating or copying precisely what someone else has done. Freedom of the press does not mean that you have the right to copy what another man has written and thus to acquire the success which this other man has duly merited on account of his achievements. It means that you have the right to write something different. Freedom of competition concerning railroads, for example, means that you are free to invent something, to do something, which will challenge the railroads and place them in a very precarious competitive situation.\n\nIn the United States the competition to the railroads\u2014in the form of buses, automobiles, trucks, and airplanes\u2014has caused the railroads to suffer and to be almost completely defeated, as far as passenger transportation is concerned.\n\nThe development of capitalism consists in everyone's having the right to serve the customer better and/or more cheaply. And this method, this principle, has, within a comparatively short time, transformed the whole world. It has made possible an unprecedented increase in world population.\n\nIn 18th-century England, the land could support only 6 million people at a very low standard of living. Today more than 50 million people enjoy a much higher standard of living than even the rich enjoyed during the 18th-century. And today's standard of living in England would probably be still higher, had not a great deal of the energy of the British been wasted in what were, from various points of view, avoidable political and military \"adventures.\"\n\nThese are the facts about capitalism. Thus, if an Englishman\u2014or, for that matter, any other man in any country of the world\u2014says today to his friends that he is opposed to capitalism, there is a wonderful way to answer him: \"You know that the population of this planet is now ten times greater than it was in the ages preceding capitalism; you know that all men today enjoy a higher standard of living than your ancestors did before the age of capitalism. But how do you know that you are the one out of ten who would have lived in the absence of capitalism? The mere fact that you are living today is proof that capitalism has succeeded, whether or not you consider your own life very valuable.\"\n\nIn spite of all its benefits, capitalism has been furiously attacked and criticized. It is necessary that we understand the origin of this antipathy. It is a fact that the hatred of capitalism originated not with the masses, not among the workers themselves, but among the landed aristocracy\u2014the gentry, the nobility, of England and the European continent. They blamed capitalism for something that was not very pleasant for them: at the beginning of the 19th century, the higher wages paid by industry to its workers forced the landed gentry to pay equally higher wages to their agricultural workers. The aristocracy attacked the industries by criticizing the standard of living of the masses of the workers.\n\nOf course, from our viewpoint, the workers' standard of living was extremely low; conditions under early capitalism were absolutely shocking, but not because the newly developed capitalistic industries had harmed the workers. The people hired to work in factories had already been existing at a virtually subhuman level.\n\nThe famous old story, repeated hundreds of times, that the factories employed women and children and that these women and children, before they were working in factories, had lived under satisfactory conditions, is one of the greatest falsehoods of history. The mothers who worked in the factories had nothing to cook with; they did not leave their homes and their kitchens to go into the factories, they went into factories because they had no kitchens, and if they had a kitchen they had no food to cook in those kitchens. And the children did not come from comfortable nurseries. They were starving and dying. And all the talk about the so-called unspeakable horror of early capitalism can be refuted by a single statistic: precisely in these years in which British capitalism developed, precisely in the age called the Industrial Revolution in England, in the years from 1760 to 1830, precisely in those years the population of England doubled, which means that hundreds or thousands of children\u2014who would have died in preceding times\u2014survived and grew to become men and women.\n\nThere is no doubt that the conditions of the preceding times were very unsatisfactory. It was capitalist business that improved them. It was precisely those early factories that provided for the needs of their workers, either directly or indirectly by exporting products and importing food and raw materials from other countries. Again and again, the early historians of capitalism have\u2014one can hardly use a milder word\u2014falsified history.\n\nOne anecdote they used to tell, quite possibly invented, involved Benjamin Franklin. According to the story, Ben Franklin visited a cotton mill in England, and the owner of the mill told him, full of pride: \"Look, here are cotton goods for Hungary.\" Benjamin Franklin, looking around, seeing that the workers were shabbily dressed, said: \"Why don't you produce also for your own workers?\"\n\nBut those exports of which the owner of the mill spoke really meant that he did produce for his own workers, because England had to import all its raw materials. There was no cotton either in England or in continental Europe. There was a shortage of food in England, and food had to be imported from Poland, from Russia, from Hungary. These exports were the payment for the imports of the food which made the survival of the British population possible. Many examples from the history of those ages will show the attitude of the gentry and aristocracy toward the workers. I want to cite only two examples. One is the famous British \"Speenhamland\" system. By this system, the British government paid all workers who did not get the minimum wage (determined by the government) the difference between the wages they received and this minimum wage. This saved the landed aristocracy the trouble of paying higher wages. The gentry would pay the traditionally low agricultural wage, and the government would supplement it, thus keeping workers from leaving rural occupations to seek urban factory employment.\n\nEighty years later, after capitalism's expansion from England to continental Europe, the landed aristocracy again reacted against the new production system. In Germany the Prussian Junkers, having lost many workers to the higher-paying capitalistic industries, invented a special term for the problem: \"flight from the countryside\"\u2014Landflucht. And in the German Parliament, they discussed what might be done against this evil, as it was seen from the point of view of the landed aristocracy.\n\nPrince Bismarck, the famous chancellor of the German Reich, in a speech one day said, \"I met a man in Berlin who once had worked on my estate, and I asked this man, 'Why did you leave the estate; why did you go away from the country; why are you now living in Berlin?'\" And according to Bismarck, this man answered, \"You don't have such a nice Biergarten in the village as we have here in Berlin, where you can sit, drink beer, and listen to music.\" This is, of course, a story told from the point of view of Prince Bismarck, the employer. It was not the point of view of all his employees. They went into industry because industry paid them higher wages and raised their standard of living to an unprecedented degree.\n\nToday, in the capitalist countries, there is relatively little difference between the basic life of the so-called higher and lower classes; both have food, clothing, and shelter. But in the 18th century and earlier, the difference between the man of the middle class and the man of the lower class was that the man of the middle class had shoes and the man of the lower class did not have shoes. In the United States today the difference between a rich man and a poor man means very often only the difference between a Cadillac and a Chevrolet. The Chevrolet may be bought secondhand, but basically it renders the same services to its owner: he, too, can drive from one point to another. More than 50 percent of the people in the United States are living in houses and apartments they own themselves.\n\nThe attacks against capitalism\u2014especially with respect to the higher wage rates\u2014start from the false assumption that wages are ultimately paid by people who are different from those who are employed in the factories. Now it is all right for economists and for students of economic theories to distinguish between the worker and the consumer and to make a distinction between them. But the fact is that every consumer must, in some way or the other, earn the money he spends, and the immense majority of the consumers are precisely the same people who work as employees in the enterprises that produce the things which they consume. Wage rates under capitalism are not set by a class of people different from the class of people who earn the wages; they are the same people. It is not the Hollywood film corporation that pays the wages of a movie star; it is the people who pay admission to the movies. And it is not the entrepreneur of a boxing match who pays the enormous demands of the prize fighters; it is the people who pay admission to the fight. Through the distinction between the employer and the employee, a distinction is drawn in economic theory, but it is not a distinction in real life; here, the employer and the employee ultimately are one and the same person.\n\nThere are people in many countries who consider it very unjust that a man who has to support a family with several children will receive the same salary as a man who has only himself to take care of. But the question is not whether the employer should bear greater responsibility for the size of a worker's family.\n\nThe question we must ask in this case is, Are you, as an individual, prepared to pay more for something, let us say, a loaf of bread, if you are told that the man who produced this loaf of bread has six children? The honest man will certainly answer in the negative and say, \"In principle I would, but in fact if it costs less I would rather buy the bread produced by a man without any children.\" The fact is that, if the buyers do not pay the employer enough to enable him to pay his workers, it becomes impossible for the employer to remain in business.\n\nThe capitalist system was termed \"capitalism\" not by a friend of the system, but by an individual who considered it to be the worst of all historical systems, the greatest evil that had ever befallen mankind. That man was Karl Marx. Nevertheless, there is no reason to reject Marx's term, because it describes clearly the source of the great social improvements brought about by capitalism. Those improvements are the result of capital accumulation; they are based on the fact that people, as a rule, do not consume everything they have produced, that they save\u2014and invest\u2014a part of it. There is a great deal of misunderstanding about this problem and\u2014in the course of these lectures\u2014I will have the opportunity to deal with the most fundamental misapprehensions which people have concerning the accumulation of capital, the use of capital, and the universal advantages to be gained from such use. I will deal with capitalism particularly in my lectures about foreign investment and about that most critical problem of present-day politics, inflation. You know, of course, that inflation exists not only in this country. It is a problem all over the world today.\n\nAn often-unrealized fact about capitalism is this: savings mean benefits for all those who are anxious to produce or to earn wages. When a man has accrued a certain amount of money\u2014let us say, $1,000\u2014and, instead of spending it, entrusts these dollars to a savings bank or an insurance company, the money goes into the hands of an entrepreneur, a businessman, enabling him to go out and embark on a project which could not have been embarked on yesterday, because the required capital was unavailable.\n\nWhat will the businessman do now with the additional capital? The first thing he must do, the first use he will make of this additional capital, is to go out and hire workers and buy raw materials\u2014in turn causing a further demand for workers and raw materials to develop, as well as a tendency toward higher wages and higher prices for raw materials. Long before the saver or the entrepreneur obtains any profit from all of this, the unemployed worker, the producer of raw materials, the farmer, and the wage earner are all sharing in the benefits of the additional savings.\n\nWhen the entrepreneur will get something out of the project depends on the future state of the market and on his ability to anticipate correctly the future state of the market. But the workers as well as the producers of raw materials get the benefits immediately. Much was said, 30 or 40 years ago, about the \"wage policy,\" as they called it, of Henry Ford. One of Mr. Ford's great accomplishments was that he paid higher wages than did other industrialists or factories. His wage policy was described as an \"invention,\" yet it is not enough to say that this new \"invented\" policy was the result of the liberality of Mr. Ford. A new branch of business, or a new factory in an already existing branch of business, has to attract workers from other employments, from other parts of the country, even from other countries. And the only way to do this is to offer the workers higher wages for their work. This is what took place in the early days of capitalism, and it is still taking place today.\n\nWhen the manufacturers in Great Britain first began to produce cotton goods, they paid their workers more than they had earned before. Of course, a great percentage of these new workers had earned nothing at all before that and were prepared to take anything they were offered. But after a short time\u2014when more and more capital was accumulated and more and more new enterprises were developed\u2014wage rates went up, and the result was the unprecedented increase in British population which I spoke of earlier.\n\nThe scornful depiction of capitalism by some people as a system designed to make the rich become richer and the poor become poorer is wrong from beginning to end. Marx's thesis regarding the coming of socialism was based on the assumption that workers were getting poorer, that the masses were becoming more destitute, and that finally all the wealth of a country would be concentrated in a few hands or in the hands of one man only. And then the masses of impoverished workers would finally rebel and expropriate the riches of the wealthy proprietors. According to this doctrine of Karl Marx, there can be no opportunity, no possibility within the capitalistic system for any improvement of the conditions of the workers.\n\nIn 1864, speaking before the International Workingmen's Association in England, Marx said the belief that labor unions could improve conditions for the working population was \"absolutely in error.\" The union policy of asking for higher wage rates and shorter work hours he called conservative\u2014conservatism being, of course, the most condemnatory term which Karl Marx could use. He suggested that the unions set themselves a new, revolutionary goal: that they \"do away with the wage system altogether,\" that they substitute \"socialism\"\u2014government ownership of the means of production\u2014for the system of private ownership.\n\nIf we look upon the history of the world, and especially upon the history of England since 1865, we realize that Marx was wrong in every respect. There is no Western, capitalistic country in which the conditions of the masses have not improved in an unprecedented way. All these improvements of the last 80 or 90 years were made in spite of the prognostications of Karl Marx. For the Marxian socialists believed that the conditions of the workers could never be ameliorated. They followed a false theory, the famous \"iron law of wages\"\u2014the law which stated that a worker's wages, under capitalism, would not exceed the amount he needed to sustain his life for service to the enterprise.\n\nThe Marxians formulated their theory in this way: if the workers' wage rates go up, raising wages above the subsistence level, they will have more children; and these children, when they enter the labor force, will increase the number of workers to the point where the wage rates will drop, bringing the workers once more down to the subsistence level\u2014to that minimal sustenance level which will just barely prevent the working population from dying out. But this idea of Marx, and of many other socialists, is a concept of the working man precisely like that which biologists use\u2014and rightly so\u2014in studying the life of animals. Of mice, for instance.\n\nIf you increase the quantity of food available for animal organisms or for microbes, then more of them will survive. And if you restrict their food, then you will restrict their numbers. But man is different. Even the worker\u2014in spite of the fact that Marxists do not acknowledge it\u2014has human wants other than food and reproduction of his species. An increase in real wages results not only in an increase in population; it results also, and first of all, in an improvement in the average standard of living. That is why today we have a higher standard of living in Western Europe and in the United States than in the developing nations of, say, Africa.\n\nWe must realize, however, that this higher standard of living depends on the supply of capital. This explains the difference between conditions in the United States and conditions in India; modern methods of fighting contagious diseases have been introduced in India\u2014at least, to some extent\u2014and the effect has been an unprecedented increase in population, but, since this increase in population has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the amount of capital invested, the result has been an increase in poverty. A country becomes more prosperous in proportion to the rise in the invested capital per unit of its population.\n\nI hope that in my other lectures I will have the opportunity to deal in greater detail with these problems and will be able to clarify them, because some terms\u2014such as \"the capital invested per capita\"\u2014require a rather detailed explanation.\n\nBut you have to remember that, in economic policies, there are no miracles. You have read in many newspapers and speeches, about the so-called German economic miracle\u2014the recovery of Germany after its defeat and destruction in the Second World War. But this was no miracle. It was the application of the principles of the free market economy, of the methods of capitalism, even though they were not applied completely in all respects. Every country can experience the same \"miracle\" of economic recovery, although I must insist that economic recovery does not come from a miracle; it comes from the adoption of\u2014and is the result of\u2014sound economic policies.",

         "content":"New energy sources and the climate crisis have transformed not only the planet, but also the global order. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Daniel Yergin speaks on CNA podcast The Climate Conversations about the shifting sands of energy and geopolitics.\n\nSINGAPORE: On Sep 14, 2019, the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia was struck by an unprecedented series of drone attacks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most important facility in the whole global oil industry,\u201d Daniel Yergin recounted on an episode of CNA\u2019s podcast, The Climate Conversations, published on Friday (Jan 8).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the past, it would have created a panic in the market. But it didn\u2019t. And a big reason was because a very large amount of US oil is not dependent (on other countries),\u201d said Mr Yergin.\n\n\u201cI can feel a palpable difference in the United States, not having the sense of being so dependent or vulnerable to events happening in the Middle East,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t just the US that\u2019s recalculating its relationships with others, Mr Yergin points out. Other key players like China, India and Russia are also contributing to the rewiring of how figurative \u201cmaps\u201d are changing because of energy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE NEW MAP OF ENERGY AND GEOPOLITICS\n\nIf anyone has a front row seat to these unfolding developments and can interpret the implications, it is Mr Yergin.\n\nAn internationally renowned energy expert, he has served on the US Secretary of Energy Advisory Board under the last four US presidents, and is Vice Chairman of IHS Markit, a leading information and research firm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is best known for winning a Pulitzer Prize for his 1990 book, The Prize: The Epic Quest For Oil, Money And Power.\n\nOn the podcast, Mr Yergin spoke to Chief Editor of CNA Digital Jaime Ho about his recently published book, The New Map, which explores how new developments and technology in energy have transformed geopolitics.\n\nBook cover of The New Map.\n\nThe New Map focuses on four major players: The US, Russia, China and the Middle East. It also discusses how the electrification of transport and the urgency of the climate crisis feature in the mix.\n\n\u201cThe old map (was when energy) trade flowed from the Middle East to the US. Now, the US is exporting energy,\u201d said Mr Yergin.\n\nCHINA\u2019S \u2018STRATEGIC PROBLEM\u2019 OF ENERGY IMPORTS\n\nWhen asked about the US and China, Mr Yergin said the relationship has \u201cchanged quite dramatically over the last five or six years\u201d.\n\nA key component of this is energy which he describes as one of the \u201cpositives\u201d in an otherwise fraught few years.\n\n\u201cFor China, it's a way to balance the trading relationship with the United States. And for the United States, China's turned out, for instance, to be a very important market for US liquefied natural gas (LNG),\u201d he said.\n\nAs China\u2019s economy and its subsequent demand for energy grow, it \u201csees its dependence on imported oil as a strategic problem\u201d, Mr Yergin said.\n\nThat explains the country\u2019s push for electric cars. \u201cIt\u2019s not just because of climate, it\u2019s not just because of pollution. It\u2019s very much strategic,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Yergin gave two reasons behind China\u2019s foray into electric vehicles: First, to reduce its imports of oil. The other is to leapfrog the global automobile market with electric cars, since Beijing recognises it cannot compete with the global internal combustion engine vehicle market.\n\nFILE PHOTO: NIO ES8 electric SUVs are seen displayed at the second media day for the Shanghai auto show in Shanghai, China, Apr 17, 2019. (REUTERS/Aly Song)\n\nChina\u2019s concern about its oil imports spills over into territorial spats. \u201cIt's no secret that the tensions between the United States and China over the South China Sea have grown,\u201d said Mr Yergin, citing near collisions of Chinese and US naval ships.\n\nHe said the Chinese worry about interruption to shipments through the Malacca Strait, \u201ca narrow strait that sees a large part of the world\u2019s oil and LNG flow through it\u201d.\n\nAs the Malacca Strait connects the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean, \u201cthe Chinese are very concerned (over protecting) the route,\u201d said Mr Yergin.\n\n\u201cThey see it as, again, a strategic issue. It\u2019s not just a trade issue,\u201d he added.\n\nWHAT A LESS ENGAGED AMERICA MEANS\n\nThe US reaching energy independence has other implications for the world too \u2013 particularly for the Middle East.\n\nBy being less dependent on Middle Eastern oil exports, \u201cthe US may just be less engaged in the region,\u201d said Mr Yergin.\n\nHe explained the peace deal between the United Arab Emirates and Israel in August 2020 was reached against that backdrop.\n\n\u201c(The UAE thought) they need to make an arrangement with the regional military power. That happens to be Israel, which has common interests vis-a-vis Iran,\u201d said Mr Yergin.\n\n(L-R) Bahrain Foreign Minister Abdullatif al-Zayani, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US President Donald Trump, and UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan signed the 'Abraham Accords' at the White House in September AFP/SAUL LOEB\n\nWhen asked about the US no longer having to frame its national and global interests in terms of oil, Mr Yergin said \u201cit means the Middle East and Asia are more tightly tied together by oil and gas than they were in the past\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou can see the focus of Gulf countries has shifted more to Asia as their future market,\u201d he said.\n\nHis take is that nations are also now more careful about picking sides. \u201cYou hear countries saying that we don't want to have to choose between our relationship with China and our relationship with the United States. Energy is part of that reason,\u201d Mr Yergin said.\n\nTHE TRANSITION AWAY FROM OIL AND GAS\n\nNaturally, the central question for Mr Yergin is how climate change fits into the energy and geopolitical narrative. He says it is \u201cremarkable\u201d how 190 countries agreed on an objective and how the movement to net-zero carbon emissions is widely adopted.\n\nYet, he says, there\u2019s complexity to ensuring everyone will get to their goals by 2050.\n\n\u201cI think sometimes people don\u2019t realise how challenging that is, given that 80 per cent of the world\u2019s energy today supporting a US$90 trillion economy is fossil fuels. It doesn\u2019t just change overnight,\u201d said Mr Yergin.\n\nDespite such complications, his prediction is that global demand for oil will ebb and that peak oil demand \u2013 when global oil consumption reaches its highest before declining \u2013 will arrive in 2030 \u201cwhether because of electric cars, government policies, or a whole host of reasons\u201d.\n\nAn energy transition is underway too in some countries. For countries such as the Netherlands and Germany, that means wind and solar, said Mr Yergin adding that solar costs have come down dramatically, which bodes well for investment in the power industry.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Power-generating windmill turbines are seen at the Eneco Luchterduinen offshore wind farm near Amsterdam, Netherlands September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nYet, not every country can meet these targets equally. He points to developing countries such as India which will face more challenges in making the transition.\n\nThey may have big ambitions to move towards wind and solar \u2013 but they also need to address poverty and the health impacts of pollution, said Mr Yergin.\n\nIs the world on track to reach net-zero emissions by 2050?\n\nMr Yergin admitted it would be \u201cchallenging\u201d.\n\n\u201cDirectionally, we know where we\u2019re going. The speed with which we get there is another question,\u201d Mr Yergin said.\n\n\u201cPart of the challenge now for a lot of countries is the extra financial burden of recovering from COVID-19,\u201d he added.\n\nListen to the full interview with Daniel Yergin on The Climate Conversations:\n\n\n\n",

         "content":"The Week That Was: 2020-12-12 (December 12, 2020)\n\nBrought to You by SEPP ( www.SEPP.org\n\nThe Science and Environmental Policy Project\n\nQuote of the Week: \u201cReal liberty is neither found in despotism or the extremes of democracy, but in moderate governments.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton\n\nNumber of the Week: 17,000\n\nTHIS WEEK:\n\nBy Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)\n\nMisleading Data: Writing for the CO2 Coalition, Richard Lindzen and John Christy address surface temperatures and the global mean temperature anomaly, which are used for the global climate models used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers to claim frightening global warming from emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) by humans. In the executive summary they state:\n\n\u201cAt the center of most discussions of global warming is the record of the global mean surface temperature anomaly\u2014often somewhat misleadingly referred to as the global mean temperature record. This paper addresses two aspects of this record. First, we note that this record is only one link in a fairly long chain of inference leading to the claimed need for worldwide reduction in CO2 emissions. Second, we explore the implications of the way the record is constructed and presented and show why the record is misleading.\n\n\u201cThis is because the record is often treated as a kind of single, direct instrumental measurement. However, as the late Stan Grotch of the Laurence Livermore Laboratory pointed out 30 years ago, it is really the average of widely scattered station data, where the actual data points are almost evenly spread between large positive and negative values.\n\n\u201cThe average is simply the small difference of these positive and negative excursions, with the usual problem associated with small differences of large numbers: at least thus far, the one-degree Celsius increase in the global mean since 1900 is swamped by the normal variations at individual stations, and so bears little relation to what is actually going on at a particular one.\n\n\u201cThe changes at the stations are distributed around the one-degree global average increase. Even if a single station had recorded this increase itself, this would take a typical annual range of temperature there, for example, from -10 to 40 degrees in 1900, and replace it with a range today from -9 to 41. People, crops, and weather at that station would find it hard to tell this difference. However, the increase looks significant on the charts used in almost all presentations, because they omit the range of the original data points and expand the scale in order to make the mean change look large.\u201d\n\nThus, based on the physical evidence used by the IPCC and its followers, the fear of CO2 causing dangerous warming is based on a statistical interpretation of the evidence coupled by a chain of interpretations that is highly questionable. The chain of reasoning is extremely weak. Terming the evidence \u201crobust\u201d and the science \u201csettled\u201d is absurd.\n\nLindzen and Christy use the BEST series of surface temperature anomalies of almost 3000 stations with at least 100 years of continuous observations to present a series of graphs. These graphs include annual temperature anomalies, seasonal temperature anomalies, and the averages (means) of these sets of data. The authors state:\n\n\u201cIn order to obscure the fact that the global means are small residues of large numbers whose precision is questionable, the common presentations plot the global mean anomalies without the scattered points and expand the scale so as to make the changes look large. These expanded graphs of global means are shown in Figures 5 and 6\u201d. [For the figures see the link to the paper.]\n\nBut by expanding the scale of the minor increases in temperatures, the advocates introduce a problem they fail to address:\n\n\u201cWe also see a reduced rate from 1998 (best seen in Fig. 6) until the major El Ni\u00f1o of 2016 occurred. Even if one could attribute all the 1978-1998 warming to the increases in CO2, the slowdown clearly shows that there is something going on that is at least as large as the response to CO2. This contradicts the IPCC attribution studies that assume, based on model results, that other sources of variability since 1950 are negligible.\u201d [For the figure see link to paper.]\n\nThe IPCC and its followers dismiss natural variation which, historically, is many times greater than the modest amount of surface warming that has occurred since 1950. Their evidence contradicts their claims. Further, since 1979 when appropriate satellite observations began, the surface warming has been greater than atmospheric warming, thus the additional warming must be coming from an additional source than greenhouse gases. Most likely, the greatest source is the urbanization and changing land use, which are dismissed by the IPCC.\n\nThe authors conclude with an interesting composite graph (Figure 9) showing the range of temperature changes in fourteen US cities. Reading from left to right, the graph shows a miniscule increase for the last 120 years, a slightly larger increase from 8 am to 10 am, a greater increase. Increases continue according to data selection; such as from sunrise to afternoon, yearly average of coldest to hottest, etc.. Humans experience these changes annually, yet the IPCC and its followers claim that a miniscule increase is frightening? In concluding, the authors state:\n\n\u201cAt the very least, we should keep the large natural changes in Figure 9 in mind, and not attribute them to the small residue, the global mean temperature anomaly, or obsess over its small changes.\u201d\n\nTo simplify some of the graphs, writing in WUWT, David Middleton puts a household thermometer next to them to show how tiny the \u201cdire global warming\u201d is. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy.\u2019\n\n********************\n\nCensorship: In the editor\u2019s note to the Lindzen and Christy paper, Caleb Rossiter, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, writes:\n\n\u201cWhen I became executive director of the Coalition two years ago, I never imagined that we would be chosen by the authors of such a paper as their publisher. Instead, I would have thought that this type of detailed piece, while written in an accessible style, would have appeared in a scholarly journal.\n\n\u201cHowever, the CO2 Coalition seems to have become a \u201cpublisher of last resort\u201d for scholarly work that falls outside an enforced, dual narrative: that there is an existential climate crisis from emissions of industrial warming gases, and that society can replace the fossil fuels that are the source of those emissions with wind and solar power, at no cost to our economy or health.\n\n\u201cAs with recent papers by economist Dr. Bruce Everett (The Social Cost of Carbon: Pick a Number, Any Number; and Do Government Policies Favoring Fossil Fuels Hamper the Development of Wind and Solar Power?) and physicists Dr. William Happer and Dr. W.A. van Wijngaarden (Methane and Climate), the authors of this paper decided that finding a home in the standard journals of their profession, in which they have published for decades, might take too much time and in fact not prove successful at all.\n\n\u201cWhy? I regret to report that there has been a steady, silent takeover of academic publishing in science and economics by the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d and \u201ceasy to change sources\u201d narrative. So, this paper, which in earlier days would have, as a matter of course, been published by a scholarly journal, now finds a home with our advocacy group.\n\n\u201cFortunately for our readers, both among experts and in the general public, we also rely on peer review, with rigor and expertise equal to that of the professional journals. And I believe that our process provides far better expertise than that of UN and U.S. governmental reports on climate science and energy economics, which are ultimately edited by a non-specialist bureaucracy and approved by governments. Our reviewers are the full board and selected members of the Coalition, a number of whom have been peer reviewers for the scholarly journals, the UN IPCC and agencies of the U.S. Government.\u201d\n\nRossiter\u2019s statement is well put. Scholarly journals now act as censors preventing \u201cundesirable\u201d ideas from reaching the public no matter how factual or scientifically important they are. Once notable scientific journals have shown they prefer government approval and acceptance by boisterous politicized advocates to applying the scientific method in analyzing the suitability of a paper. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy.\n\n********************\n\nIncorrect Physics? After TWTW began commenting on the work of van Wijngaarden and Happer on the greenhouse effect and the extension of that work by Howard Hayden, several readers stated that they too have trouble getting their work published. They use different databases such as MODTRAN rather than HITRAN used by van Wijngaarden & Happer to arrive at their conclusions that the greenhouse effect is greatly overestimated,\n\nThe global climate models are modified weather models which have many issues: they cannot predict more than ten days to two weeks in advance, often far less. They must be updated at least daily or several times a day. The long-term prediction value of such modeling is highly suspect. Weather is subject to many more influences than the greenhouse effect. The work of Lindzen and Christy, above, shows how difficult it is to extract a clear signal from noisy land-surface temperature data that is considered the finest (BEST). It may be that the approach by the climate modelers is simply the wrong approach to capture the greenhouse effect in the noisy data.\n\nThe issue is to understand the impact on global temperatures from increasing greenhouse gases such as CO2. Rather than apply the physics of weather change to capture this influence, a better physics may be Atomic, Molecular and Optical physics (AMO). Over the next several weeks TWTW will attempt to simplify the work of van Wijngaarden & Happer and Hayden so that it is more understandable to the general reading public. TWTW is edited by reviewers competent in the needed science. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy.\n\n********************\n\nGreenland Heat: Antarctica has four volcanoes above the ice and extensive geothermal hotspots below the ice along the Antarctic Peninsula and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Much of the fear of CO2-caused sea level rise from Antarctic melting stems from a misunderstanding of the role of geothermal activity in melting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which may take thousands of years. Over this time a new cooling may begin.\n\nBased on newly published research, the feared melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet may be from geothermal activity deep in the earth well below the ice. The Greenland plume (column) of geothermal heat is associated with the Svalbard plume and the Iceland plume. The cause of the Iceland heat is easily seen by tourists. Stopping human CO2 emissions will do nothing to stop geothermal heat. See links under Changing Earth and https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/new-antarctic-heat-map-reveals-sub-ice-hotspots/\n\n********************\n\nHurricane Season: Hurricane season has ended with press claims that was the busiest season ever. The busiest aspect of the season was naming storms that no one bothered to name before. Neil Frank, the past director of the National Hurricane Center, describes the types of a) tropical disturbances usually associated with hurricanes and b) disturbance originating in the subtropics (outside the Tropics with latitudes between 23\u00ba and 35\u00ba north and south of the Equator), called baroclinic disturbances. He writes:\n\n\u201cThe number of named storms generated by tropical disturbances has not decreased, but there has been a significant increase in the number of named storms generated by baroclinic disturbances. Has there been a change in the philosophy of naming baroclinic-driven, winter-like storms that occur in the summer? If so, does this contaminate the historical record of Atlantic hurricanes, making more the numbers for the last 25 years not directly comparable with the numbers for the previous 50?\u201d\n\nFrank concludes:\n\n\u201cWith all of the uncertainties in the raw data, the only credible indicator of any trend in Atlantic hurricane activity is to look at the major hurricanes (Categories 3\u20135) making landfall in mainland USA. A tropical storm or even a weak hurricane might have hit a sparsely populated region in the 1800s or the early 1900s and gone undetected. In contrast, all major hurricanes with winds in excess of 110 mph crossing the U.S. coastline in the last 175 years have probably been recorded.\n\n\u201cContrary to the claim that global warming is causing more named storms, over the past several decades the number of major hurricanes hitting the U.S. coastline has fallen. There were none for twelve years (2005\u20132017). This was the longest period on record without a major hurricane. On average, one major hurricane crosses the U.S. border every two years.\n\n\u201cIn contrast to mainstream media claims, there has been no increase in Atlantic hurricane activity in recent decades. As a matter of fact, world-wide there has been a 5\u201310% decrease in hurricane-type storms in the last 50 years.\u201d\n\nIn their comments, Madhav Khandekar and Tom Harris make an interesting observation for those who live along the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic Coast:\n\n\u201cThe fact that hurricanes and other tropical cyclones are not caused, or even significantly enhanced, by man does not give us an excuse to do nothing about them, however. Florida and Texas need to engage in \u2018vertical evacuation\u2019 by building multistory storm shelters that allow residents to take refuge above the storm surge, instead of today\u2019s ineffective \u2018horizontal evacuation,\u2019 forcing people to flee the waves on clogged highways. The U.S. should look to India\u2019s storm shelter network for an example of success in this regard\u2014no one need walk more than one kilometer anywhere on India\u2019s coast to get to a shelter. If India can afford it, why not the U.S.?\u201d\n\nIn many areas, concrete and steel multistory buildings make great sense for protecting the public. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Changing Weather.\n\n********************\n\nSEPP Not SPPI: A Climate Denier Roundup by Daily Kos demonstrates fact checking or the lack thereof. It states:\n\n\u201cEven before Fred Singer\u2019s passing this year, his Science and Public Policy Institute, once a leading denial organization, had been silent since early 2019.\u201d\n\nFred Singer has never been associated with the Science and Public Policy Institute (SPPI). He was the founder of the Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP). Readers of TWTW can be assured that SEPP continues to speak loudly. See links under Communicating Better to the Public \u2013 Go Personal.\n\n********************\n\nBalanced Budget Multiplier: Perhaps one of the worst of many bad ideas coming from applying mathematics to the general ideas expressed by Lord Keynes was the balanced budget multiplier. Using mathematics, economists claimed government can expand the economy by increasing taxation and by increasing spending by the same amount. A strong advocate was the highly influential Paul Samuelson, who received the Nobel Prize for economics. Samuelson also advocated that the economy of the Soviet Union was comparable to that of the US because its military was comparable. The economic policies of Soviet Union were a perfect example of the balanced budget multiplier, government takes and spends all. Until the Soviet Union imploded.\n\nIn his column in the Wall Street Journal, Andy Kessler discusses the folly of using budget multipliers that have not been carefully validated. See Article # 2.\n\n********************\n\nA Real Budget Multiplier? In the UK, a real budget multiplier is appearing. In its net-zero plan, as government is committing more to wind and solar power, the costs to the consumer are escalating rapidly. As Andrew Montford writes:\n\n\u201cApart from the secrecy over a matter of vital public concern, even a brief consideration of what needs to be done shows that all of the Whitehall estimates are so absurdly low as to smack of an almost complete lack of numeracy, or worse, a complete lack of honesty, among senior civil servants.\u201d\n\nPaul Homewood writes about the UK\u2019s Sixth Carbon Budget:\n\n\u201cThe UK only accounts for 1% of global emissions, so whatever we do will have no effect at all on the climate. Meanwhile, despite COVID, this year China has continued to build new coal power stations, increasing its generating capacity by 3%. In the last two years, the rise in China\u2019s emissions of carbon dioxide has exceeded our total emissions.\u201d\n\nSee links under Questioning European Green\n\n********************\n\nGovernor Nos: According to WorldoMeters, as of Dec 11. the death rate in the US from those with COVID-19 is 922 per one million (less than 0.1 %). Most deaths have other complications such as age. According to the CDC, the 1918-19 death rate of US citizens from \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d was about 6,500 per million (more than 6 times greater). Yet, today, governors are declaring extreme limitations on liberties today, far beyond what they declare in the past? This punishment of the public has little relationship to the reality of the virus. See Article # 1 and https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries\n\n********************\n\nAnthropocene: In attempting to claim we are in a new era called the Anthropocene two Professors of Paleobiology, the biology of fossil animals and plants, begin with:\n\n\u201cOur deficiencies have always driven us, even among our distant ancestors, back in the last Ice Age. Having neither the speed and strength to hunt large prey, nor sharp teeth and claws to tear flesh, we improvised spears, flint knives, scrapers. Lacking a thick pelt, we took the fur of other animals.\u201d\n\nThey conclude with:\n\n\u201cSince the mid-20th century, the Earth has been set on a new, human-driven trajectory \u2013 one that is leaving the stable conditions of the Holocene Epoch, and is entering the uncertain, and rapidly changing, new world of the Anthropocene. The weight of evidence, here, seems unarguable.\u201d\n\nApparently, one cannot assume that Professors of Paleobiology know that humans evolved in the Tropics of Africa and that the International Commission on Stratigraphy used physical data to divide the Holocene Epoch into three parts, each marked by a significant cooling: Greenlandian (11,700 years ago to 8,200 years ago), Northgrippian (8,200 years ago to 4,200 years ago) and Meghalayan (4,200 years ago to the present). See links under Communicating Better to the Public \u2013 Make things up.\n\n********************\n\nNumber of the Week: 17,000. Historian John Robson discusses that the high estimate of carbon dioxide emissions by the UN IPCC, called Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP8.5, is so extreme that it is untenable, totally impossible. He states that in work published in May, Roger Pielke Jr. and Ritchie Justin found that about 17,000 published papers used this indefensible estimate. As Pielke and Justin write:\n\nClimate science research and assessments have misused scenarios for more than a decade. Symptoms of this misuse include the treatment of an unrealistic, extreme scenario as the world\u2019s most likely future in the absence of climate policy and the illogical comparison of climate projections across inconsistent global development trajectories.\n\nThus, the papers use indefensible high-end estimates of CO2 emissions and climate models that cannot be validated and greatly overestimate the influence of CO2 on temperatures. What should such papers be called \u2013 fictionalized science or science fiction?

(Translation, editing, subheadings by P Gosselin), Via No Tricks Zone, Dec 6, 2020\n\n\u201cClimate science consensus is a myth, scientists silenced\n\n\u201cThe worldwide consensus on the CO2 issue is repeatedly pointed out. This was mainly due to the fact that skeptical scientists were often silenced in an unseemly manner, and their work no longer published (also because publishers were afraid of fanatics who were ready to commit terror). Skeptics, often inappropriately called \u201cclimate deniers\u201d, are insulted, silenced under threats or career consequences. Yet, the scientific research institutes (climate impact research) run by the state at high cost would have to be closed down if they accepted CO2 as insignificant. Many jobs would be lost. This cannot be risked. But a consensus among those (where a vast majority cannot be experts in the field \u2013 there are not that many) is not a scientific criterion.\n\n\u201cConsensus as proof?

The Restaurant Lockdown Massacre\n\nNew shutdown orders punish minorities and low-income workers.\n\nEditorial, WSJ, Dec 11, 2020\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-restaurant-lockdown-massacre-11607730189?mod=hp_opin_pos_1\n\nTWTW Summary: The editorial states:\n\n\u201cNew York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo on Friday joined the stampede of Democratic governors shutting down restaurants despite scant evidence that they are driving a surge in Covid cases. Their shutdowns are hitting minorities the hardest and increasing economic inequality.\n\n\u201cDemocratic governors in Michigan, Illinois, Oregon and Washington in recent weeks have closed indoor dining. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has banned outdoor patios in most areas too. Mr. Cuomo said Friday that he\u2019s shutting down indoor dining in New York City as of Monday.\n\n\u201cAccording to state contact tracing data, restaurants and bars account for 1.4% of the virus spread in the state while household gatherings make up nearly 74%. That\u2019s not surprising. In New York City, restaurants were limited to 25% capacity. Who limits capacity in their living rooms during football watch parties or Thanksgiving?\n\n\u201cRestaurants and other small businesses have spent heavily to comply with government Covid regulations, including buying personal protective equipment for staff and improved ventilation systems. But now they are being punished because, well, government can\u2019t control the virus and Democratic leaders feel they must appear to be doing something.\n\n\u201cDemocratic governors probably expect Congress to pass a Covid relief bill with more aid for small businesses. But this won\u2019t cover all their rent, utilities and other overhead. The National Restaurant Association this week said 110,000 restaurants have permanently shuttered in 2020, notwithstanding forgivable government loans.\n\n\u201cMore relief will help some restaurants survive the winter, but fewer if they are limited to takeout. Many low-earning servers and cooks will be laid off. Unemployment benefit claims increased nationwide this week as restaurants in many states were ordered to shut down. Continuing claims in California rose 139,078 in the week of Nov. 28.\n\n\u201cBut small business owners that permanently shut down will lose the equity they have built over many years. The result will be more socioeconomic inequality.\n\n\u201cA Federal Reserve report this fall showed that net worth (assets minus liabilities) between 2016 and 2019 increased significantly more among blacks (32.1%) and Hispanics (63.6%) compared to whites (4%). One reason was huge growth in business equity among blacks (138%) and Hispanics (63%).\n\n\u201cThe Fed on Thursday reported that U.S. household net worth in the third quarter hit a record high amid the stock and housing boom. Government\u2019s pandemic response, especially low-interest rates, has made the rich richer. But small businesses and their workers have been crushed.\u201d\n\nAfter dismissing claims of possible recovery by the Biden administrations the editorial states the governors placing heavy restrictions are talking of their administrations recovering with higher taxes.\n\n\u201cMr. Cuomo knows there aren\u2019t enough wealthy left in New York to fix the state\u2019s budget problems, which preceded the pandemic. Soaking the wealthy will cause more to flee to no-income-tax Florida, where restaurants and even Disney World are still open\u2014and there are even fewer per-capita new Covid cases than in New York.\u201d\n\n*****************\n\n2. A Stimulus Dollar Is Only a Dollar\n\nDemocrats devise magic \u2018multipliers\u2019 to justify spending, but the returns never show.\n\nBy Andy Kessler, WSJ, Dec 6, 2020\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/a-stimulus-dollar-is-only-a-dollar-11607279296?mod=hp_opin_pos_3\n\nTWTW Summary: The columnist writes:\n\n\u201cWait for it . . . any day now . . . get ready for the \u2018multipliers.\u2019 You know, the idea that a government dollar spent magically turns into multiple dollars in the economy. We ought to start hearing that silly word again as the lame-duck coronavirus stimulus negotiations kick in. Expect more multiplier mumbo jumbo as the Biden administration begins its tax-and-spend fiesta.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, the Democrats haven\u2019t had a believable economic messenger since Robert Rubin during the Clinton administration. Since then they\u2019ve presented a cast of characters\u2014 Larry Summers, Mr. Biden\u2019s adviser Jared Bernstein, and lately Elizabeth Warren \u2014who bend themselves into pretzels to justify higher spending and then higher taxes.\n\nThe author presents a number of multipliers claimed in the New York Times in 2008 then continues:\n\n\u201cThe economy grew after the Great Recession, as it does after every recession. The stimulus didn\u2019t stimulate. Shovel-ready projects weren\u2019t ready. Many complained that the stimulus wasn\u2019t big enough. More hooey. The Obama administration\u2019s high taxes and heaps of regulation held the economy back. Is spending driving today\u2019s recovery? Think back to the Heroes Act 2.0, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Economic growth in the third quarter of 2020 was 33% as lockdowns were lifted, despite\u2014or because of\u2014that gigantic stimulus package not becoming law.\n\n\u201cThe theory of multipliers is based on the Keynesian view that poorer consumers tend to spend a large amount of increased income, and the rich less so. But multipliers are half a story. Someone has to put up the original money that allegedly gets multiplied, taking it away from the private sector and negating whatever dwindling chain of transactions are hypothesized. It\u2019s like two waves canceling each other out\u2014you can\u2019t just do the math on the additive public wave and ignore subtracting the private. This demand-side theory omits the principle of productivity, the real driver of economic growth and prosperity.\u201d\n\nThe article discusses failed multipliers during the Obama administration then continues:\n\n\u201cActually, if you want to see a real multiplier in action, take Amazon. Since it began, it\u2019s had $47 billion in invested capital, equity and debt. It\u2019s worth a tad more than that now. Just sayin\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhat else will be justified with multipliers? Maybe nationalizing the 5G network and reinstating net neutrality. The pesky private sector can\u2019t be trusted, the reasoning might go. This isn\u2019t voodoo economics, it\u2019s froufrou or even tutu economics: dressed up to look good but only a facade.\n\n\u201cAbout the only government spending that might actually multiply in the real economy is basic research\u2014pure, fundamental research. Not enough, and you become a Third World has-been. Too much and you get Solyndra. Sure, I\u2019d like to see money spent on basic research for nuclear fusion, advanced artificial intelligence, and genomic drug development. But keep it research; don\u2019t add in development as in R&D. And please don\u2019t slap a multiplier on the money spent, a number pulled out of thin air. How long will it be before Mr. Biden\u2019s pick for Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, who studied under the Keynesian James Tobin, uses the M-word?\u201d\n\n*****************\n\n0 0 vote Article Rating\n\nShare this: Print\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

         "Prediction_result":1,
         "content":"The number of police officers who have died in the line of duty in 2020 has jumped by nearly 60% compared to last year as the ongoing spread of the coronavirus continues to take its toll on America\u2019s men and women in blue.\n\nThe National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund is reporting 210 total fatalities this year -- a 58% increase from the 133 it recorded in 2019.\n\n\"The year 2020 has proven to be a horrific year for law enforcement,\" the organization told Fox News in a statement. \"America\u2019s law enforcement officers were confronted with the pandemic, protests, and defund police movements, which made it not only one of the most challenging years in recent memory, but one of the deadliest.\"\n\nPOLICE, LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE BEEN HOT-BUTTON ISSUE IN 2020\n\n\"The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund has confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic has accounted for more officer line-of-duty deaths than firearms or traffic fatalities combined,\" it added. \"NLEOMF has also determined that the total number of fatalities will be the largest since the terrorist attacks in 2001.\"\n\nPreliminary statistics on the memorial website indicate there were 118 deaths this year from \"other causes\" such as the coronavirus, while 48 were \"firearms-related\" and 44 were \"traffic-related.\" The organization plans to issue a final report in early January.\n\nStatistics from the Officer Down Memorial Page, which also tracks the deaths of officers in the U.S. and its territories, indicate that a higher number have died on-duty this year: 296, with the contagious virus being by far the leading cause. Last year, it reported that 148 officers died in the line of duty.\n\nThe website is attributing 179 of this year\u2019s deaths to complications caused by the coronavirus, 45 to gunfire and 20 to automobile crashes, amongst other sources.\n\nST.

         "title":"Forecast 2021 \u2014 Chinese Fire Drills With a Side of French Fries (Jacobin-style) and Russian Dressing",
         "Prediction_result":1,
         "content":"As I write, the presidential election is still not resolved, with dramatic events potentially unfolding in the first days of the New Year. I\u2019m not convinced that Mr. Trump is in as weak a position as the news media has made him out to be in these post-election months of political fog and noise. The January 6 meet-up of the Senate and House to confirm the electoral college votes may yet propel matters into a constitutional Lost World of political monsterdom. The tension is building. This week\u2019s public demonstration by one Jovan Hutton Pulitzer of the easy real-time hackability of Dominion Voting Systems sure threw the Georgia lawmakers for a loop, and that demo may send reverberations into next Wednesday\u2019s DC showdown.\n\nThere may be some other eleventh-hour surprises coming from the Trump side of the playing field. As I averred Monday, we still haven\u2019t heard anything from DNI Ratcliffe, and you can be sure he\u2019s sitting on something, perhaps something explosive, say, evidence of CIA meddling in the election. There have been ominous hints of something screwy in Langley for weeks. The Defense Dept., under Secretary Miller, took over all the CIA\u2019s field operational functions before Christmas \u2014 \u201cNo more black ops for you!\u201d That was a big deal. There were rumors of CIA Director Gina Haspel being in some manner detained, deposed and\u2026talking of dark deeds. She was, after all, the CIA\u2019s London station-chief during the time that some of the worst RussiaGate shenanigans took place there involving the international men-of-mystery, Stefan Halper, Josepf Mifsud, and Christopher Steele. Mr. Ratcliffe seemed to be fighting with the CIA in the weeks following the election over their slow-walking documents he had demanded.\n\nWhat else does Mr. Trump know about this rumored inter-agency feud? Or a number of other fraught matters surrounding the election, and also questions concerning the harassment he suffered from the four-year rolling coup run by his Deep State antagonists (many of them CIA). What does he know of China\u2019s infiltration into our national affairs, of which the Biden Family\u2019s business deals with CCP-connected companies is only one piece? Or of China\u2019s relationship with Dominion systems \u2014 China is rumored to have acquired a 75-percent interest in the company as recently as October.\n\nIn any case, the president cut short his holiday break in Florida before New Years Eve to fly back to Washington. The company line is that he wants to exhaust all the prescribed legal procedures to contest the November 3 vote tally. And if none of it avails to correct the outcome, he might move on to\u2026 something else. If even the so-far publicly revealed evidence of the Biden family\u2019s influence-peddling schemes overseas is true \u2014 and the emails and corporate memoranda from Hunter\u2019s laptop seem genuine \u2014 then it would be Mr. Trump\u2019s duty to prevent Joe Biden from becoming president. And outside the constitutionally-mandated process in the national legislature, that would leave him some sort of other emergency executive action.\n\nMr. Trump has called for a gigantic assembly of his supporters on January 6 in Washington. He didn\u2019t call them there to watch him get humiliated. Something is up. You can feel it in the air. I\u2019ll give it a fair chance that Donald Trump is the one with his hand on the bible come January 20. One caveat to all that: 2021 is going to be very rough sledding, with many discomforts, traumas, and things left behind for America. Whoever occupies the Oval Office is going to be buried in trouble. In theory, I would have preferred to see a Democrat left holding that awful bag, if only as payback for all their bad faith and dirty fighting of the past four years. But Mr. Trump is apparently willing to shoulder that burden, and, in such an existential emergency, he\u2019s likely to be a better leader than the corrupt and feckless Ol\u2019 White Joe.\n\nOkay, I\u2019m going to just come right out and splatter a bunch of individual forecast predictions up-front in this lead chapter, and if you\u2019re interested, you can continue on to the finer points and arguments below. I\u2019m grateful for all of you interested readers coming here twice a week, and for those of you who keep this outfit afloat with your Patreon support. A healthy, sane, purposeful, and upright 2021 to you!\n\nA Bill of Particulars for 2021\n\nThe election is re-adjudicated, fraud subtracted from the tally, and President Trump is declared the winner.\n\nThe mail-in vote for the Georgia Senate seat runoff is disqualified as systematic fraud is revealed. Stacy Abrams is indicted for organizing the fraud.\n\nA number of political celebrities, DC swamp rats, K-Street hustlers, media figures, and tech company executives are arrested and charged with serious crimes around election fraud.\n\nThe CIA is purged and reduced to a strictly analytical role for advising the executive.\n\nThe FBI is likewise purged; Director Wray is charged with obstruction of Justice.\n\nFollowing the reversal of the news media\u2019s election narrative (and the actual election results), Black Lives Matter and Antifa are loosed upon a number of cities and wreak considerable destruction, but eventually get their asses kicked by federal troops. City mayors who allowed the havoc to proceed are arrested, charged with abetting insurrection, and removed from office pending trial.\n\nNancy Pelosi replaced as Speaker of the House. Mitch McConnell replaced as Majority Leader.\n\nUS Attorney John Durham brings charges against lawyers involved in the Mueller Investigation, including Andrew Weissmann, Aaron Zebly, Brandon Van Grack and Jeanie Rhee. Mr. Mueller is named as an unindicted co-conspirator due to mental incompetence.\n\nA special Prosecutor is named to investigate the Biden family business operations; indictments follow late 2021.\n\nStock market enters long, deep asset value deflation through first and second quarters and bottom-bounces the rest of the year. S & P falls to 550 range; DJI under 10,000; Nasdaq under 3000.\n\nThe dollar DXY index falls under 80 by 2 nd quarter, 60 at year end.\n\nquarter, 60 at year end. US GDP down by 40-percent year end 2021.\n\nUS oil production (minus natural gas liquids) down by 40-percent, year-end 2021.\n\nBanking system thrown into disarray due to non-payment of rents and mortgages. Federal government intervenes with direct renter relief payments. Home owners in default are allowed to remain in their houses on provisional basis (which is never reconciled).\n\nBubonic plague outbreak among homeless of Los Angeles as rats proliferate in their encampments.\n\nPension funds collapse as broken chain of rent-and-mortgage payments destroy Real Estate Investment Trusts.\n\nFederal government forced to organize massive food giveaway programs.\n\nMillions enrolled in make-work projects a la the New Deal (some of them of value).\n\nNew York City forced to curtail subway service to bare minimum as money runs out.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom recalled out of office.\n\nGeorge Soros and several directors of Soros-funded NGOs charged with racketeering and election campaign finance crimes.\n\nGeneral Motors, Chrysler, and Ford are back seeking bankruptcy protection. This time, their assets are sold and reorganized into smaller companies. No bailouts.\n\nCovid virus fades from the scene by 3 rd quarter, but economic carnage remains. Huge amount of restaurant equipment sold for dimes on the dollar.\n\nquarter, but economic carnage remains. Huge amount of restaurant equipment sold for dimes on the dollar. Bitcoin \u201cHodlers\u201d becoming Bitcoin \u201cSodlers\u201d as cryptos tank.\n\n\u201cWoke\u201d hysteria evaporates as Americans struggle with desperate reality-based problems of everyday life.\n\nCollapse of higher education begins in earnest as college loan racket implodes. Scores of colleges and even some universities shutter; others shrink drastically in desperate effort to carry on.\n\nHollywood celebrities apologize en masse for past \u201cWoke\u201d behavior, beg forgiveness from cancel victims and fans. Nevertheless, collapse of the movie industry continues as, post-Covid, Americans desperately seek the company of other people instead of canned entertainments, which they have grown sick of.\n\nProfessional sports collapse as business model fails. Impoverished Americans start-up low-cost, local baseball and football leagues.\n\nTwitter and Facebook become public utilities.\n\nThe Covid Crisis and Economic Meltdown\n\nI won\u2019t have a whole lot to say about the Covid-19 virus that others have probably analyzed better elsewhere, so I\u2019ll make it short. In the fog of pandemic, it\u2019s hard to know who or what to believe. The outbreak in early 2020 induced similar official responses and social changes in many other nations, raising the question: did the whole world get played? If so, it was quite a stunt. Was it intended as a cover to enable the much blabbed-about \u201cGreat Reset?\u201d More on that below.\n\nOne big mystery is how, in China, the disease seemed mostly contained within Wuhan and its Hubei province, and how rapidly that country got over it compared to so many other places around the world where the illness lingered and got a second wind in the fall. All that said, it\u2019s apparent that, in America, the virus was gamed opportunistically by the Resistance and its news media handmaidens, first to make Mr. Trump look as bad as possible, then to promote the mail-in ballot scheme that led to a fraud-riddled election.\n\nMuch of the confusion about the disease itself \u2014 ventilators or not\u2026 masks or no masks\u2026 hydroxychloroquine or not\u2026 lockdowns or not \u2014 ended up damaging the authority of the medical and scientific experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Deborah Birx, Surgeon General Adams, the NIH and the FDA, and is still not settled to many people\u2019s satisfaction. And, as if we didn\u2019t already have a big enough problem with failing institutional authority, that scientific failure added to our already acute cultural corrosion. I\u2019m suspicious of the statistics regarding true case numbers and the official spinning of Covid-19 deaths actually from other causes, as well as the tests that produced so many false conclusions. It seems pretty obvious in these tense weeks post-election that The New York Times, CNN, and other media have worked to ramp up the Covid hysteria to distract the public from emerging news about the contested election.\n\nWhat\u2019s quite clear about the whole Covid-19 episode to date is how badly the states\u2019 government response harmed the small businesses of America that make up at least 40 percent of the economy. According to Bloomberg News, more than 110,000 restaurants shut down, 17 percent of them permanently out-of-business, surely with more to come with the winter lockdowns. More than three million employees lost their jobs in that industry alone. Data from the University of California Santa Cruz indicates that nearly 317,000 small businesses closed between February and September, 60 percent for good.\n\nThe nation\u2019s economic affairs were in considerable disorder before the Covid-19 virus threw things into more desperate disarray. Decades of off-shoring industry decimated the working class. In much of Flyover Country, the working class has been reduced to a demoralized idle-and-addicted class with a strikingly high suicide rate, especially for men. The situation only improved marginally under President Trump, who, after all, was bucking practically all of corporate America, which liked the benefits of off-shoring just fine.\n\nI believe that working class will return to laboring, and not in the giant American factories of the kind we had in the 1960s, but because the government social safety nets will be running out of financial mojo in the coming decade. So, they will have no choice but to labor \u2014 at the same time that many automated activities we\u2019ve enjoyed will not be running much longer. A lot of that automation has been applied, for instance, in agriculture, where one person could plow or harvest hundreds of acres a day riding in the air-conditioned cab of a multi-million-dollar rig guided by GPS, allowing the driver to watch movies while he \u201cworked.\u201d Well, that agri-business model is about to fail. The scale is all wrong and the capital requirements are too exorbitant. Bottom line: many idle working-class folk have a future in agricultural work. They don\u2019t know it yet. Expect, also, more opportunities as household servants as American society becomes more distinctly hierarchical, and in more fine-grained strata than merely the rich and the poor. Far from being an evil outcome, consider how important to human psychology it is to have a place in this world, both in terms of purpose and a physical place to call home. And, anyway, how wonderful is the former working-class\u2019s current plight as drug-addled, often homeless, and suicidal? Would you want things to stay that way, or can you imagine new social arrangements to meet new economic realities?\n\nThe consolidation of commerce into a few giant companies such as Walmart, Target, Amazon had reached a deadly and tragic pitch before Covid-19, destroying all lesser organisms in the business ecosystem, and thousands of local Main Streets in the process. With the Covid lockdowns, the big boxes were somehow exempted from closure. Though they seem to be triumphing for the moment, these giant national chain merchandising outfits are in their sunset phase headed for twilight. As I\u2019ll surely state again in this forecast, the macro-trend is for downscaling and re-localizing in everything, all activities. The chain-stores and big boxes depend on systems and arrangements that won\u2019t persist, for instance, the long supply lines from the factories of Asia. The end of mass motoring will also prove problematical for commerce at the giant scale smeared all over suburban landscapes. And, of course, Amazon\u2019s business model of home delivery for absolutely anything and everything, was perfectly suited to the Covid-19 crisis \u2014 though in the longer term its model will prove fatally flawed, since it depends on trucking every single item to its customers, and the reason will become evident further down.\n\nThe catastrophic failure of so much small business in America through 2020 will provide the seeds for a rebirth of small businesses when the giants fall. A lot of equipment will be available at dimes on the dollar. Rents will be cheap. Enterprising people will have to be careful about where they decide to set up for new businesses: better Main Street than out on some empty strip-mall. Consolidation will be working in a different way \u2014 not to make companies bigger, but to bring many small businesses closer together in places people can get to without a car (what used to be known as a business district or downtown or Main Street). America is not going to need nearly as much shopping infrastructure as we had before 2020, and also not nearly as many restaurants. But we\u2019re going to need some of these things and done in a new way. I can also imagine new businesses that would have been unthinkable a year ago. At some point when Covid-19 exits the scene, people will want to get together with other people very badly. Think about opening a dance hall or a nightclub with live music, even a live performance theater.\n\nThe American economy had already entered a zone of dangerous structural fragility before Covid-19 stepped onstage. As Tim Morgan and Gail Tverberg argue so well in their respective blogs, the economy is an energy system that, in the advanced techno-industrial form, depends absolutely on fossil fuels, which have become a problem the past two decades, leading to the present inflection point bringing on de-growth, the onset of a long emergency, and what others call a fourth turning. Same things, really. We\u2019ve entered a state of contraction, and it\u2019s in the nature of large economic organisms to move from contraction to collapse fairly quickly, because the complex interconnections in their systems ramify and amplify each other\u2019s failures. The virus has made it all worse, and faster.\n\nOil\n\nHardly anyone paid any attention to the oil story this year with all the frightful distractions of Covid-19, the economic havoc of lockdowns, and the janky election. The oil story is probably more important than any other single factor in the current situation, and is largely responsible for America\u2019s economic mess. Everything in the USA runs on oil and our business model for doing that is broken. De-growth changes everything.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2008, we were on a downward slide with our conventional oil supply \u2014 the kind of oil where you just drill a pipe into the ground and the oil flows out, or, at worst, gets sucked out by a pump-jack \u2014 all-in-all, a simple procedure. In 2008, total US oil production was under 5-million barrels-a-day, down from the old production peak of just under 10-milliion b/d in 1970. And of course, our consumption kept going up to about 20-million b/d by 2008. So, we were importing most of our oil then.\n\nThat created terrible problems for our balance-of-payments in international trade, but we fudged that by pretending for decades that deficits don\u2019t matter, as Veep Dick Cheney famously put it. The result, via the recondite and pernicious operations of financialization \u2014 that is, replacing a production economy with one based on the sheer manipulation of money and its derivatives \u2014 was the 2008-9 Great Financial Crisis. The GFC was presaged in the summer of 2008 by the price of a barrel of oil reaching just under $150 \u2014 which badly strained what remained of real productive industry. The dynamic in play induced political authorities to quit regulating wild misconduct in finance and banking, as they attempted to replace productive industry with money games. These malfeasances played out most vividly in real estate and the \u201cinnovative\u201d securitized mortgage bonds that were gamed to a fare-the-well by the banks. The abstruse crimes have been chronicled widely elsewhere (e.g., my 2012 book Too Much Magic). But consider, also, that all the mortgage fraud of the early 2000s was based on the last gasp of the suburban expansion, and understand that suburbia was entirely at the mercy of mass motoring, which depended on affordable oil.\n\nSo, oil shot up to just under $150, the economy wobbled, the banks and the automobile companies had to be bailed out and central bank interventions became normalized, including zero interest Federal Reserve policy, a desperate legerdemain to keep up the appearance of a sound economic-financial gestalt. And that led to the \u201cshale oil miracle.\u201d\n\nIt was more a stunt than a miracle, really. First, you had this suite of techniques that could be employed to goose the last bit of oil from otherwise unproductive source rock. These included computerized horizontal drilling and the injection of fluids plus chemicals to fracture the impermeable rock and release the oil. This was \u201cfracking.\u201d It was not new but had not been scaled up into a major activity while the easier pickings were good. It was way different from the old simple method of drilling a pipe in the ground and letting it flow out of permeable rock. The old simple method cost about a half million dollars (in current dollars) per well to drill and start the oil flowing. Shale oil, with all its complications, cost between $6-12 million per well. The old 1960s conventional oil wells produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. The new shale wells produced maybe 100-odd barrels a day for the first year and they were done after four years. The depletion rate was horrendous.\n\nShale oil was made possible by the Federal Reserve\u2019s ultra-low-interest, easy lending policies. They made a lot of cheap capital available, and hundreds of billions migrated to the new shale oil plays in expectation that they would produce excellent steady revenues. Big institutional investors like pension funds and insurance companies especially were looking for reliable revenue with bond interest rates so low due to Fed policy. They thought they\u2019d be swimming in shale oil company dividends and revenue streams from loans to shale drillers that paid better than US treasury bonds. One thing for sure, they thought: America wasn\u2019t going to stop needing lots of oil. So, shale oil seemed like a sure thing. Except that after a few years, it turned out that nobody was making any money producing shale oil.\n\nIt just cost so damn much to get that stuff out of the ground. And the depletion rate was so savage that you had to drill and re-drill incessantly. And what was worse, the economy had evolved to the stage where there was no sweet spot for oil prices. Oil over $75 destroyed the business model for productive industrial activities that relied on cheap oil; while oil under $75 destroyed oil companies because they couldn\u2019t make a profit at the well head. The melodrama played out over ten years through several rounds of Fed Quantitative Easing (money creation from nowhere) and relentless run-ups of government deficits. The oil companies themselves were caught in a \u201cRed Queen syndrome\u201d (ref.: Alice Through the Looking Glass) in which they were producing as much and as fast as they could just to keep up their cash flow to make loan repayments, without generating any profits \u2014 and quite a few companies couldn\u2019t even keep up with their loan repayments, so shale was a total bust for them and they went bankrupt. It all came to a head in early 2020.\n\nJust before the Covid-19 virus hit, shale oil production stood at over 9 million barrels a day, with another roughly 4 million from conventional oil, offshore oil, and natural gas liquids, for a grand total of nearly 13 million barrels a day in US oil production, a new record! That was 3 million b/d higher than the previous peak of 1970, at just under 10 million b/d. Quite a feat! Added to that was just under 5 million b/d in natural gas liquids. Daily US consumption was around 20 million b/d heading into 2020. It fell briefly during the initial Covid panic to around 15 million b/d and bounced back a little to around 18 million b/d in the fall of 2020. So, production appeared to be basically equal to our consumption.\n\nHowever, the quality of the oil skewed the equation of \u201coil independence.\u201d Shale oil tended to be ultra-light oil, composed mostly of gasoline-grade distillates. Fine, America uses a lot of gasoline because we drive everywhere and incessantly so. The trouble is, shale oil contains little of the crucial heavier distillates: diesel fuel, which the trucking industry and heavy machinery depends on, aviation fuel (basically kerosene), and bunker fuel, a heavy oil fuel for home heating and ships\u2019 engines. Neither did those nearly 5 million barrels a day of natural gas liquids, which were really only used for cutting heavy oil, which was mostly what the USA did not produce and was not well-equipped to refine. The bottom line was that the US had to swap a lot of gasoline to other countries to get heavier distillates to keep the economy going. It worked, but it was awkward and involved a tremendous amount of transport. So, America\u2019s oil situation coming out of 2019 was superficially stabile but fragile.\n\nBut entering 2020, shale oil production was in collapse. The lack of profitability finally caught up with the industry. Investors finally noticed that the shale oil producers couldn\u2019t make money. At one flukey point in the Covid-19 spring of 2020, the oil markets became so disordered by collapsing demand that oil on the futures market cratered to a surreal negative-$40 a barrel. It soon corrected to the positive-$30-40 range, which was not nearly enough for the shale oil business to turn a profit. Consequently, the companies could not get new financing to continue their \u201cRed Queen\u201d operations, and without new financing they could not keep up cash flow\u2026 and they crapped out. Thirty-six producers filed for bankruptcy in 2020, including Chesapeake, Oasis, Lonestar, Ultra, Whiting, and Chaparral. Oil field service companies that are subcontracted to perform the drilling and fracking have also gone bust.\n\nShale oil production fell by roughly 2.7 million b/d from March to May 2020, recovered a little at mid-year and stumbled again with the winter wave of the virus. Oil analyst Steve St. Angelo predicts that total US oil production (shale and everything else) will fall to between 9.5 and 10 million b/d in 2021, which would put us back to 1970 levels when the nation\u2019s population was just 205 million (compared to 330+ million today). So, that\u2019s a lot less oil-per-capita, to view it from another angle. Independent oil analyst Art Berman is predicting a more severe production crash by midyear 2021 to roughly half what it was at year-end 2019. Nafeez Ahmed, Director Institute for Policy Research & Development, is simply calling this the end of the oil age. Ahmed says it \u201cwill begin over the next 30 years, and continue through to the next century.\u201d\n\nI believe it will go down much quicker than that because falling production is so destructive to the business model of industrial society that it will induce gross economic, social, and political disorder. All that disorder will generate self-reinforcing feedback loops making a return to previous levels of comfort, convenience, prosperity, and order much less likely. The net effect will be a much lower standard-of-living among formerly \u201cadvanced\u201d nations, and also falling populations. We\u2019re just experiencing the beginning of that process with the destruction of America\u2019s middle-class. It is the essence of the long emergency. We just can\u2019t tell right now how far down these dynamics will drive us, and how fast. 2021 is likely to manifest intense disorder in the USA as people reel from the loss of small businesses, economic conditions deteriorate further, and political grievance gets amped up by institutional failure to resolve, or even address, our many problems and quandaries.\n\nAs for transitioning into a \u201csustainable economy\u201d powered by \u201crenewables\u201d such as solar and wind power, that just ain\u2019t going to happen \u2014 unless you\u2019re talking about oxen and firewood, and a human population about ten percent of what the planet currently carries. All our fantasies about a high-tech utopia driven by wind and sun depend on a fossil fuel economy to produce the hardware for it and then the replacement parts for the hardware, ad infinitum. It\u2019s not worth going into it further here, but if you want to see more elaborate arguments, they\u2019re in my recent book Living in the Long Emergency (BenBella Books, 2020).\n\nThe So-called Great Reset\n\nLife in the USA, and other \u201cadvanced\u201d nations will reset, but not in the way that most people blabbering about \u201cthe Great Reset\u201d think or say it will.\n\nSurely, there are groups, gangs, claques, and covens of people in the world who have some consensual agreement about how things might work, and how they would run them to their benefit, in their hypothetical ideal disposition of things. For instance, the so-called \u201cDavos Crowd.\u201d What are they? A convocation of bankers, market movers, politicians, business moguls, tech entrepreneurs, Hollywood catamites, black ops runners, and PR errand boys who have plenty of financial and political mojo in their own realms, but not enough collectively to carry out the kind of global coup that comprises the standard paranoid Great Reset fantasy. That they meet-up in an ultra-luxurious setting out of a James Bond movie every year stokes terrific fascination, envy, anger, and paranoia that they are capable of anything beyond a festival of ass-kissing, mutual self-congratulation, and status-jockeying, which are the actual activities at the Davos meet-up.\n\nFor another thing, in the USA, at least, there are too many pissed-off people with small arms, hardened by years of proffered bad faith and dishonesty from the political/media/higher-ed complex, to just bend over and take it up the back-door from a gang of seditious, would-be aristo-totalitarians with l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 dreams of nostalgie-de-la-boue Marxist redemption. If you have any doubt about how disruptive angry people with small arms and lots of ammo might be to condescending elites, just review the events in the Middle East the past twenty years and imagine those dynamics transferred to Kansas.\n\nWhat does the \u201creset\u201d fantasy supposedly include? A \u201cnew world order,\u201d a phantasm of a unified world government, which is preposterous because the macro-trend at this moment of history worldwide is the opposite of consolidation and centralization of power, but rather breakup, downscaling, and re-localization. Why? As you saw in the Econ chapter, because the scale, pitch, and range of all our activities must be reduced to survive in the post-industrial conditions of resource and capital scarcity. And it will happen whether we like it or not and despite anybody\u2019s objections.\n\nWhat else is in the Reset grab-bag? Supposedly a single world currency, also absurd for reasons already stated \u2014 unless you are talking about gold and silver, which may eventually become the universally-accepted medium of exchange (and store of value, index of price) if the post-industrial contraction is severe and destructive enough. But fuggeddabowt \u201cdigital currencies,\u201d especially in the USA because too many people are \u201cun-banked,\u201d or otherwise depend on cash-money in the informal \u201cgray\u201d economy of just-getting-by (and there will be a lot more of these types as the middle-class gets pounded further down into the mud), plus a large cohort of digitally-capable people just plain ornery about being herded into an IRS surveillance cul-de-sac \u2014 and the whole lot of them will fight like hell to prevent government-sponsored crypto-dollars from replacing what used to be considered money. And, if, in the unlikely event that rebellion fails, it\u2019s back to gold and silver by default \u2014 and that might literally mean by default.\n\nNow, I grant you that there are fer sure problems with all the major currencies, especially the USA dollar, and they are all liable to become worthless eventually for all the usual and traditional reasons. The US dollar is especially vulnerable since its status as the world\u2019s \u201creserve\u201d currency \u2014 a reliable medium of exchange in global trade \u2014 is no longer consistent with the true financial condition of our country, which is morbidly obese with debt that will never be repaid \u2014 a terminal case. There will eventually be some kind of default, either the straightforward way, by declaring nonpayment to bond-holders and creditors outright, or by sneakily engineering a hyper-inflation of the money supply to destroy the value of the dollar. If either of those events plays out, the nation will be thrust into serious social and political disorder, blame will get cast, people will get hurt, and it will be a while before the finer points of the social contract get pasted back together \u2014 such as any agreement to introduce a \u201cnew dollar\u201d of some kind to replace the ruined old one. By then, the old USA may not still be standing intact, and it would be up to states or regions to address the money issue.\n\nI don\u2019t believe it will be settled as a new digital money for reasons outlined above, but also because digital money is utterly dependent on the Internet, which, in turn, is utterly dependent on a reliable electric grid, and both systems are susceptible to going down in the kind of socio-political convulsion that would attend financial collapse. Not only would transactions become impossible, but records of money ownership \u2014 \u201cwallets,\u201d or files \u2014 could be permanently lost, wiping out fortunes. This obviously includes Bitcoin and things like it. Blockchain is only as strong as the chain, and without the Internet there\u2019s no chain at all. So, again, gold and silver must enter the picture, perhaps backing a paper currency, perhaps circulating as coin.\n\nIn the meantime of such a crisis, very little of daily life would come out the other end looking the way it used to in the years prior to 2020. We\u2019ll see a Great Reset, all right, but not some totalitarian gruel dished out to the plebes from the Davos steam-table or any other elite catering service. It will be an emergent, self-organizing phenomenon, from the ground up, in which everyday people will have to improvise new systems at the local level for getting food, arranging for shelter, and creating business activities around their most fundamental needs: food production, transport, trade, manufacturing, energy supplies, medical care, cleaning, building, et cetera.\n\nI\u2019ve been saying for a while that this might amount to \u201cgoing medieval.\u201d Could be better, could be worse. Well, there it is. There\u2019s your Great Reset for you. Stand by and prepare to scramble.\n\nThe Abyss Stares Back\n\nThe federal eviction moratorium passed by Congress with the spring 2020 onset of Covid-19 will expire at the end of January as things stand now, placing 30-million renters at risk of losing their dwellings. Another 28-million house-holders have been placed in a mortgage moratorium. What happens a month from now? Well, for one thing, don\u2019t overlook the brutal fact that these moratoria don\u2019t excuse anybody from having to pay all the back rent and back mortgage installments that were suspended for the year. The federal government just can\u2019t keep rolling that forward forever because it thunders through the banking system. If landlords don\u2019t get paid, they cannot pay their mortgages \u2014 and most rental real estate is mortgaged to allow for a coherent cash-flow, tax payment, and business model. Neither can the landlords pay their taxes to the municipalities (states and US government). The cities are especially harmed by collapsing tax revenue because they can\u2019t keep with infrastructure repair, can\u2019t cover pensions, or schools, the vicious cycle of urban decay.\n\nHow are people who have lost businesses and livelihoods going to come up with the money to make up these back payments. They probably will not. So far, there is no national discussion of that problem, but we\u2019re seeing the first signs of an emotional response in rent rebellions under the banner \u201ccancel rent.\u201d This quandary points to the likelihood of a campaign for the federal government to bail out renters and homeowners, and/or a campaign for the program that made its debut in the 2020 Democratic primaries, \u201cuniversal basic income\u201d (UBI). Either one of those has a fair chance of happening as America\u2019s economic collapse proceeds and politicians panic.\n\nThese programs won\u2019t work. As soon as they are bailed out for their old debts, the renters and home \u201cowners\u201d will start racking up new back-payments if they have not done enough to generate a regular income, or simply can\u2019t because the economy is so broken. And then what? Another bail out in six months? All the money creation to fuel that wheel of futility will only hasten the inflationary depreciation of the dollar as ever more money is created from thin air to make these bail-outs and hand-outs. The kind of UBI that was bandied about in the 2020 primaries, especially by candidate Andrew Yang, amounted to $1000-a-month. Most renters probably could not cover their monthly rents out of that, not to mention all the other costs of living. So then what? $5000-a-month? If you\u2019re going to give away large sums of money for nothing, why not just make every impoverished American a millionaire? (And then watch the price of a Dunkin\u2019 donut go up to $150.)\n\nA parallel crisis has also ripened in commercial real estate as companies adjust to their employees working from home and try to get out of their leases \u2013 or just bail if their leases are up for renewal. The office building may not be altogether a thing of the past, but it won\u2019t be like it was before 2020, and the problem is most acute in a place like New York or Chicago where midtown is chockablock with megastructures that went from being assets to liabilities virtually overnight. We have no idea what will become of them, but I doubt they will be retrofitted into apartments for two reasons: 1) the cost would be out-of-this-world, and 2) the apartment tower is just an accessory to the office tower, and if the office towers are obsolete, so are the apartment towers.\n\nThis leads to what I have been saying since I wrote Too Much Magic: our cities are going to contract substantially; the process is going to painful; and there will be battles over who gets to inhabit the districts that, for one reason or another, retain value \u2014 waterfronts, older small-scale, low-rise neighborhoods. Covid-19 plus riots-and-looting have prompted people-of-means to resettle hastily in the suburbs. But this trend is a head-fake. Facing the oil problems that we do, the suburbs will quickly follow the cities into disutility and dysfunction. The people who moved there the past year will discover that they made a major mistake, especially if they bought a house.\n\nThe more permanent shift will be to America\u2019s small cities and small towns, places scaled to the energy and capital resource realities coming down on us, including the need to live closer to where your food is grown.\n\nThis snowballing national existential fiasco certainly suggests the need to reorganize the American economy and the choices are pretty stark. The Democratic Party and the whole left-leaning side of the transect is inclined to attempt centralized control of economic activity in a way that strongly resembles the gigantic national experiments of the 20th century that went by the name of socialism. I mean\u2026 what else can you call it? It doesn\u2019t really exist anymore in practice, not even in China, which is now merely totalitarian racketeering state. The 20th century was a moment in history when everything really was growing in scale, and with it came a wish for controlling all that by national governments. It was tried in many places and everywhere it was tried it ended in tyranny, hardship, and mass murder\n\nThings have changed. They have reversed. Things are contracting. So, the other choice we have is to go with that flow, scale down the things we do and the terrain we occupy and the range of things we think we can control. That will ultimately be the only choice, of course, since the urge for a new statist socialism is against the current impulse of history, and therefore against nature. It will fail and then we will have to get with the program that the zeitgeist actually offers.\n\nWokesterism\n\nSometimes societies just lose their shit and go crazy and that is kind of what happened to America in 2020. The distress had been building for years, especially since the GFC of 2008-9 when the middle-class began dissolving in earnest. Now, their grown children discern that the future is going to be very unlike the recent past, and that their programmed hopes and dreams do not jibe with what that future actually requires of them: rigor, realism, earnestness, and rectitude. It\u2019s too much for them. It\u2019s too painful. And they\u2019re not ready for it. They retreat into fantasy, cynicism, and ambiguity. So instead of virtue, we got virtue-signaling and, in adults who ought to know better, the kind of bratty behavior you\u2019d expect from 13-year-old girls.\n\nThe ground for this was prepared by a society that opted to turn most of its important institutionalized activities into rackets, most particularly, higher education, which entered a late-stage metastasizing expansion fed by government guaranteed loan racketeering. The loan racket allowed the universities and colleges to jack up their tuition extravagantly, which prompted them to regard their debt-burdened, overpaying students as customers, which evolved into just plain pandering to their every wish.\n\nAlready in place, as a legacy of the 1960s, was a faculty of crusaders and activists in revolt against the bourgeois indignities of their own comfortable lives, making common cause with all other imagined \u201cvictims of oppression\u201d as a form of careerist theater. They concocted curricula of bullshit disciplines for various victim-identity cohorts to monetize their grievance obsessions, and it all worked splendidly until Covid-19 ripped through the campuses and started blowing up the whole business model. And now college enrollments are headed down an estimated 20 percent for 2021, and an awful lot of the not-so-well-endowed schools will be going out of business, with even better-endowed schools soon to follow.\n\nAnother thing happened in parallel to the grievance hysterias on campus. The half-century-long civil rights campaign that went up a dead-end with all the family-destroying social services policies of the late 20thcentury, became such a manifestly embarrassing failure with an ever-growing hostile and dangerous underclass, that, in abject shame and disappointment, all of white liberaldom had to come up with an excuse for that failure, which finally fluoresced as Critical Race Theory with its hobgoblin-in-chief, systemic racism.\n\nHence: Black Lives Matter, based on the fantasy that white policemen were engaged in a genocide against people of color. Really, what you had with Trayvon Martin of Sanford, FLA, Michael Brown of Ferguson, MO, Tamir Rice, of Cleveland OH, and a long line of insta-martyrs, was a series of extremely ambiguous incidents at best, and, at worst, episodes of teens with poor impulse control acting out in ways very likely to get them into big trouble. And then, finally, with the maddening Covid-19 upon the land, and temperatures rising around Memorial Day, came George Floyd, middle-aged ex-con (home invasion, armed robbery, etc.), sometime porn star, hustler, a drug abuser who was \u201cturning his life around\u201d in Minneapolis, suddenly trapped under the knee of officer Derek Chauvin\u2026.\n\nBlack Lives Matter can be simply understood as a well-funded hustle, and by \u201chustle\u201d I mean a program for dishonestly extracting goods from others, a crude \u201cstreet\u201d variation of a racket. BLM also features a patina of moral fakery, namely its supposed \u201cMarxist\u201d credo \u2014 an attempt to appear intelligent and political where it is actually merely criminal. In reality, it\u2019s just a destructive force, a vehicle for punishing its perceived enemies, especially the police who are supposedly (but not in reality) perpetrating racist genocide. This gets to the heart of the Wokesterism more generally in all its aspects from Critical Race Theory to cancel culture to the #Me Too game. Its animating purpose is coercion, the wish to push other people around, to find excuses to punish them, and to do it for the sheer sadistic pleasure of watching them squirm, suffer, lose their livelihoods, and perish. That\u2019s it. The rest is sheer bullshit.\n\nIn the new year, the ongoing economic carnage will be so severe that the nation may not have time for the finer points of Woke theory and philosophy, or the patience to hear tedious explications of identitarian complaints. Women will have to stop pretending to be an alt version of men, and begin conceiving of some plausible role for themselves as a complementary division of the human race in a new and harsh struggle to thrive. Woke cries of \u201cracist, racist, racist\u201d will no longer be greeted with supplication, apologies, and cosseting. Claims of special victimhood will be laughed out of the public meetings. For the first time in decades in the USA, everyone will have to pull his-or-her own weight, and shut the fuck up about it. Hard times will shake America out of its squishy fantasies and concentrate millions of minds on looking after their basic needs without mommy-hugs, participation trophies, or affirmative action line-jumping.\n\nAntifa, a Woke auxiliary with a really bad attitude, spent most of the Covid-19 year as a social space for youth meet-ups as all the usual social venues \u2014 campuses, bars, coffee shops, parties, concerts, etc \u2014 all got locked-down. In Seattle, WA, Portland, OR, Minneapolis, MN, Philly, PA, and NYC, NY, where feckless politicians forced police to stand down, or crippled them with sanctions against the use of force, or just fired a bunch of them wholesale, Antifa rioters discovered that it was especially fun to play adult versions of capture-the-flag or ring-a-leevio on warm summer nights with the cops. They got to wear groovy street-fighting outfits and wield umbrellas against gas attacks, and the hormonal young men showboated acts of derring-do with fireworks, skateboards, baseball bats, and, more than once, alas, firearms. If they happened to get rounded up by the police, the local DA\u2019s let them go and many returned to the fun riots time after time, all summer long.\n\nA lot of property got damaged, statues of famous Americans got pulled down, spray-painted, peed-on, busted up, decapitated. Businesses having a hard enough time staying afloat under the Covid lockdowns, had their storefronts smashed, equipment and merchandise looted. Fifty years from now, wrinkled old Antifas will recall how romantic it was. In 2021, the public will lose patience with any further Antifa antics in the streets. They will just get their little umbrellas shredded and their asses kicked, and they\u2019ll go weee-weee-weee back to whatever the equivalent of a crash-pad is nowadays, or to mommy\u2019s basement. We\u2019ll also learn a thing or two about who was funding Antifa in 2020, paying for their airplane tickets to stage their fun riots in city after city, and make sure they were well-supplied with pallets of bricks, Roman candles, and bear spray. Many of today\u2019s Antifas will be tomorrow\u2019s agricultural laborers. Having spent their youth rioting, drugging, playing with their gender presentation and their phones, they won\u2019t be qualified for anything else.\n\nChinese Fire Drills with Russian Dressing\n\nDonald Trump attempted to put the schnitz on the established order of things between the US and China, which had steadily turned against our own national interest. For a couple of decades, they sent us cheap manufactured goods and we sent them US treasury bond paper. China liked that arrangement well enough, but it really wasn\u2019t working out so well for us. Having given away our manufacturing sector to them, and everybody else in East Asia, our working class no longer had decent-paying jobs and were increasingly strapped to buy all that cheap stuff made in China, even at low, low Walmart prices. So, Mr. Trump made a stink about it and slapped tariffs on Chinese goods, and they have lately been dumping US treasury paper instead of loading up on it as before. They still hold over a trillion dollars\u2019 worth, and they can\u2019t dump a whole bunch of it at once without destroying its value. And we still buy a lot of stuff from China, though the relationship is now very fraught.\n\nSome say we\u2019re at war with China, that it\u2019s a new kind of war, an information and infiltration war. Just what and who does China own in the USA? The American people are starting to find out. Gawd knows what else our unreliable Intel Community knows. Perhaps China owns our CIA now. Perhaps that\u2019s why Mr. Trump has been so busy stripping away the CIA\u2019s various perqs and capacities. We\u2019ve learned for sure that they bought and paid for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, through a series of lucrative business deals made by his son, Hunter, with a subsidiary of China\u2019s own Intel Agency. Nobody seems to care about that at the moment \u2014 but maybe they will care more as we approach his hypothetical inauguration.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that China put a bid on Congressman Eric Swalwell (D-CA), a majority member of the House Intel Committee. They sent a little fortune cookie named Fang Fang over to California some years ago when Mr. Swalwell was a member of the Dublin, CA, city council, and she hung with him for years, bundling campaign money and helping him rise into a congressional seat. He was rumored to be playing hide-the-winter-melon with her, for years. Was he owned? Nobody seems to care for now. Perhaps that will change.\n\nAnd, of course, we learned some time ago that Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) had a Chinese (national) chauffeur and go-fer for twenty freakin\u2019 years \u2014 including her years as chair of the Senate Intel Committee. He vamoosed to China when his identity as a spy was revealed. Nobody cares. That\u2019s what a sloppy-ass country we\u2019ve become.\n\nChina, apparently, has thousands upon thousands of carefully placed agents throughout America, especially in big academic research centers and American tech companies and even the news media. Reports say that a Chinese company purchased a 75-percent interest in Dominion Voting Systems for $400-million from Staple Street Capital in October 2020 in a shadowy deal run through the Swiss Bank UBS. It has been demonstrated that Dominion voting machines used in the recent national US elections, were connected to the Internet, though, by law, they are not allowed to be connected. Weird, a little bit. Connected to whom? So far, nobody seems to care.\n\nOh, and there was China\u2019s Lunar New Year gift to America almost a year ago: Covid-19.\n\nThanks, China. What do we actually know about how that went down? Apparently, they are busy as I write destroying virus samples in the Wuhan lab.\n\nWill this so far informational and economic war between China and the US heat up and become a different kind of war? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much in it for China to go that route. Anyway, they\u2019ve got their hands full waiting to see if their bought-and-paid-for errand boy, Mr. Biden, actually becomes president and also perhaps waiting to see exactly how the USA falls apart in the coming year. They will lose a lot of customers for patio furniture and sundry other stuff, but then they won\u2019t have to worry about us monitoring all their activity elsewhere around the world, where, let\u2019s face it, they have a lot going on. The main thing is, China is nearly as fragile as we are, only in different ways. They don\u2019t have whole lot of oil reserves, and they\u2019re burning almost 13-million barrels a day, of which they produce close to 5-million and import the rest. Not a great situation, and not appreciably better than our own. Their banking system is at least as janky as ours, probably worse, since their banks only have to answer to the CCP and they can paper-over any financial sucking chest wound. A global depression could create serious unemployment problems for them, and hence political pressure on and within the CCP. For 2021. If, by some chance, Donald Trump ends up back in the White House, things could go a bit more non-linear.\n\nReports emerged only days ago that President Xi Jinping will be undergoing brain surgery for a worsening aneurysm. They imply a power struggle in the CCP to ensue in the event that the surgery doesn\u2019t turn out well. I can\u2019t confirm these rumors, but there it is\u2026 just sayin\u2019\u2026.\n\nRussia appears best positioned to sit out the economic disorders of the West and the discontents of China. Russia has already been through a traumatic economic and political collapse and emerged much lightened, streamlined, and viable. Due to punitive US sanctions, she has had to develop an import-replacement economy, supplying more of her own needs. She has about twice the proven oil reserves as the USA and less than half our population. She has been steadily acquiring gold reserves and has been making noises about establishing a gold-backed currency \u2014 which would be a real novelty in a world of fiat junk money. She has a well-educated and relatively homogenous population of capable people who have recovered psychologically from the 75-year-long political mind-fuck of communism. She has an arsenal of world-beating hypersonic nuclear weapons. She has rational and intelligent political leadership. And Russia just passed a law stating that anyone who brings false #MeToo accusations against another citizen faces five years in prison. One looks on in awe!\n\nEurope\n\nAchhhhh. Fugeddabowdit. No oil. No mojo. Buried in debt. Failing social safety nets. Over a million hostile Muslim immigrants looking to burn the joint down. In 2021, the EU will break down and states will scramble desperately to shore up their economies. They will not succeed. Disorders follow and governments will fall. Angela Merkel waves goodby to das volk. Boris Johnson faces a no confidence vote in parliament. Macron survives and gets very tough, but France grows poor and bitter. Everybody starts saying nice things about Victor Orban.\n\nThere\u2019s the whole shootin\u2019 match. Forgive me for leaving out only about ten thousand other topics and issues, including climate change, about which I will only say: believe it or not, we\u2019ve got more urgent things to worry about.

         "content":"The Trump tax cut promised to accelerate long-term growth by stimulating business investment. That promise was broken; business investment did not rise. The Trump tax cut imposed indefinite trillion-dollar deficits upon the United States even before the pandemic crisis, while conferring little, if any, benefit on economic output.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade policy was an utter fiasco, and his much ballyhooed U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement simply inserted more automobile protectionism into the old NAFTA, without addressing the big North American trade issues of the 21st century, especially the needs of the digital economy and cross-border shipping.\n\nTrump did appoint a lot of judges, but that was a partisan achievement, not a national one: a zero-sum win for conservative Americans, not a legacy for the nation as a whole.\n\nYet nobody does nothing as president, not even someone who watches television for five or six hours a day. There were achievements in the Trump years, and even if they hardly begin to compare to Jimmy Carter\u2019s, they are still worth noting as this presidency comes to an end. I have below tallied a baker\u2019s dozen of accomplishments that a majority of Americans, Democrats as well as Republicans, can reckon as successes of the Trump era.\n\nStricter regulation of vaping\n\nVaping technology can help adult smokers quit, but it can also lure teenagers into addiction. In January 2020, Trump signed regulations restricting the use of fruit and mint flavorings in vaping cartridges. This was not as bold an action as anti-tobacco groups sought, but it was not nothing, either. Trump almost immediately regretted his benign action. Two weeks later, he complained on the phone to Health Secretary Alex Azar, \u201cI should never have done that fucking vaping thing.\u201d But the policy remains, despite Trump\u2019s change of heart.\n\nDramatic reductions in the burning of coal\n\nCoal is the most environmentally dangerous of all fuels. In 2016, as a candidate, Trump vowed that the U.S. would soon burn more of it. Instead, U.S. coal consumption declined in every year of his presidency. In 2019, the U.S. burned 586 million tons of coal\u2014a reduction of almost 50 percent from the 2007 peak, and a drop of almost 15 percent over 2018.\n\nThis was not a result Trump wanted. A harder-working president might even have thwarted it. But in this one crucial respect, Trump\u2019s legendary laziness has left the world a cleaner and greener place.\n\nRead: America\u2019s coal consumption entered free fall in 2019\n\nNormalization in the Middle East\n\nPresident Trump moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and proposed a peace plan that substituted economic development for immediate Palestinian statehood. Traditional experts feared that Trump\u2019s policies would ignite regional conflict. Instead, if anything, the region has calmed. First the United Arab Emirates, then Bahrain and Sudan, and most recently Morocco have opened diplomatic relations with Israel. It\u2019s now possible to fly direct from Tel Aviv to Dubai, overflying Saudi Arabia.",

         "content":"Clusterfuck Nation\n\nFor your reading pleasure Mondays and Fridays\n\nSupport this blog by visiting Jim\u2019s Patreon Page\n\nAnd thanks to all my Patrons for your support!\n\nAs I write, the presidential election is still not resolved, with dramatic events potentially unfolding in the first days of the New Year. I\u2019m not convinced that Mr. Trump is in as weak a position as the news media has made him out to be in these post-election months of political fog and noise. The January 6 meet-up of the Senate and House to confirm the electoral college votes may yet propel matters into a constitutional Lost World of political monsterdom. The tension is building. This week\u2019s public demonstration by one Jovan Hutton Pulitzer of the easy real-time hackability of Dominion Voting Systems sure threw the Georgia lawmakers for a loop, and that demo may send reverberations into next Wednesday\u2019s DC showdown.\n\nThere may be some other eleventh-hour surprises coming from the Trump side of the playing field. As I averred Monday, we still haven\u2019t heard anything from DNI Ratcliffe, and you can be sure he\u2019s sitting on something, perhaps something explosive, say, evidence of CIA meddling in the election. There have been ominous hints of something screwy in Langley for weeks. The Defense Dept., under Secretary Miller, took over all the CIA\u2019s field operational functions before Christmas \u2014 \u201cNo more black ops for you!\u201d That was a big deal. There were rumors of CIA Director Gina Haspel being in some manner detained, deposed and\u2026talking of dark deeds. She was, after all, the CIA\u2019s London station-chief during the time that some of the worst RussiaGate shenanigans took place there involving the international men-of-mystery, Stefan Halper, Josepf Mifsud, and Christopher Steele. Mr. Ratcliffe seemed to be fighting with the CIA in the weeks following the election over their slow-walking documents he had demanded.\n\nWhat else does Mr. Trump know about this rumored inter-agency feud? Or a number of other fraught matters surrounding the election, and also questions concerning the harassment he suffered from the four-year rolling coup run by his Deep State antagonists (many of them CIA). What does he know of China\u2019s infiltration into our national affairs, of which the Biden Family\u2019s business deals with CCP-connected companies is only one piece? Or of China\u2019s relationship with Dominion systems \u2014 China is rumored to have acquired a 75-percent interest in the company as recently as October.\n\nIn any case, the president cut short his holiday break in Florida before New Years Eve to fly back to Washington. The company line is that he wants to exhaust all the prescribed legal procedures to contest the November 3 vote tally. And if none of it avails to correct the outcome, he might move on to\u2026 something else. If even the so-far publicly revealed evidence of the Biden family\u2019s influence-peddling schemes overseas is true \u2014 and the emails and corporate memoranda from Hunter\u2019s laptop seem genuine \u2014 then it would be Mr. Trump\u2019s duty to prevent Joe Biden from becoming president. And outside the constitutionally-mandated process in the national legislature, that would leave him some sort of other emergency executive action.\n\nMr. Trump has called for a gigantic assembly of his supporters on January 6 in Washington. He didn\u2019t call them there to watch him get humiliated. Something is up. You can feel it in the air. I\u2019ll give it a fair chance that Donald Trump is the one with his hand on the bible come January 20. One caveat to all that: 2021 is going to be very rough sledding, with many discomforts, traumas, and things left behind for America. Whoever occupies the Oval Office is going to be buried in trouble. In theory, I would have preferred to see a Democrat left holding that awful bag, if only as payback for all their bad faith and dirty fighting of the past four years. But Mr. Trump is apparently willing to shoulder that burden, and, in such an existential emergency, he\u2019s likely to be a better leader than the corrupt and feckless Ol\u2019 White Joe.\n\nOkay, I\u2019m going to just come right out and splatter a bunch of individual forecast predictions up-front in this lead chapter, and if you\u2019re interested, you can continue on to the finer points and arguments below. I\u2019m grateful for all of you interested readers coming here twice a week, and for those of you who keep this outfit afloat with your Patreon support.

Scores of colleges and even some universities shutter; others shrink drastically in desperate effort to carry on.\n\nHollywood celebrities apologize en masse for past \u201cWoke\u201d behavior, beg forgiveness from cancel victims and fans. Nevertheless, collapse of the movie industry continues as, post-Covid, Americans desperately seek the company of other people instead of canned entertainments, which they have grown sick of.\n\nProfessional sports collapse as business model fails. Impoverished Americans start-up low-cost, local baseball and football leagues.\n\nTwitter and Facebook become public utilities.\n\nThe Covid Crisis and Economic Meltdown\n\nI won\u2019t have a whole lot to say about the Covid-19 virus that others have probably analyzed better elsewhere, so I\u2019ll make it short. In the fog of pandemic, it\u2019s hard to know who or what to believe. The outbreak in early 2020 induced similar official responses and social changes in many other nations, raising the question: did the whole world get played? If so, it was quite a stunt. Was it intended as a cover to enable the much blabbed-about \u201cGreat Reset?\u201d More on that below.\n\nOne big mystery is how, in China, the disease seemed mostly contained within Wuhan and its Hubei province, and how rapidly that country got over it compared to so many other places around the world where the illness lingered and got a second wind in the fall. All that said, it\u2019s apparent that, in America, the virus was gamed opportunistically by the Resistance and its news media handmaidens, first to make Mr. Trump look as bad as possible, then to promote the mail-in ballot scheme that led to a fraud-riddled election.\n\nMuch of the confusion about the disease itself \u2014 ventilators or not\u2026 masks or no masks\u2026 hydroxychloroquine or not\u2026 lockdowns or not \u2014 ended up damaging the authority of the medical and scientific experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Deborah Birx, Surgeon General Adams, the NIH and the FDA, and is still not settled to many people\u2019s satisfaction. And, as if we didn\u2019t already have a big enough problem with failing institutional authority, that scientific failure added to our already acute cultural corrosion. I\u2019m suspicious of the statistics regarding true case numbers and the official spinning of Covid-19 deaths actually from other causes, as well as the tests that produced so many false conclusions. It seems pretty obvious in these tense weeks post-election that The New York Times, CNN, and other media have worked to ramp up the Covid hysteria to distract the public from emerging news about the contested election.\n\nWhat\u2019s quite clear about the whole Covid-19 episode to date is how badly the states\u2019 government response harmed the small businesses of America that make up at least 40 percent of the economy. According to Bloomberg News, more than 110,000 restaurants shut down, 17 percent of them permanently out-of-business, surely with more to come with the winter lockdowns. More than three million employees lost their jobs in that industry alone. Data from the University of California Santa Cruz indicates that nearly 317,000 small businesses closed between February and September, 60 percent for good.\n\nThe nation\u2019s economic affairs were in considerable disorder before the Covid-19 virus threw things into more desperate disarray. Decades of off-shoring industry decimated the working class. In much of Flyover Country, the working class has been reduced to a demoralized idle-and-addicted class with a strikingly high suicide rate, especially for men. The situation only improved marginally under President Trump, who, after all, was bucking practically all of corporate America, which liked the benefits of off-shoring just fine.\n\nI believe that working class will return to laboring, and not in the giant American factories of the kind we had in the 1960s, but because the government social safety nets will be running out of financial mojo in the coming decade. So, they will have no choice but to labor \u2014 at the same time that many automated activities we\u2019ve enjoyed will not be running much longer. A lot of that automation has been applied, for instance, in agriculture, where one person could plow or harvest hundreds of acres a day riding in the air-conditioned cab of a multi-million-dollar rig guided by GPS, allowing the driver to watch movies while he \u201cworked.\u201d Well, that agri-business model is about to fail. The scale is all wrong and the capital requirements are too exorbitant. Bottom line: many idle working-class folk have a future in agricultural work. They don\u2019t know it yet. Expect, also, more opportunities as household servants as American society becomes more distinctly hierarchical, and in more fine-grained strata than merely the rich and the poor. Far from being an evil outcome, consider how important to human psychology it is to have a place in this world, both in terms of purpose and a physical place to call home. And, anyway, how wonderful is the former working-class\u2019s current plight as drug-addled, often homeless, and suicidal? Would you want things to stay that way, or can you imagine new social arrangements to meet new economic realities?\n\nThe consolidation of commerce into a few giant companies such as Walmart, Target, Amazon had reached a deadly and tragic pitch before Covid-19, destroying all lesser organisms in the business ecosystem, and thousands of local Main Streets in the process. With the Covid lockdowns, the big boxes were somehow exempted from closure. Though they seem to be triumphing for the moment, these giant national chain merchandising outfits are in their sunset phase headed for twilight. As I\u2019ll surely state again in this forecast, the macro-trend is for downscaling and re-localizing in everything, all activities. The chain-stores and big boxes depend on systems and arrangements that won\u2019t persist, for instance, the long supply lines from the factories of Asia. The end of mass motoring will also prove problematical for commerce at the giant scale smeared all over suburban landscapes. And, of course, Amazon\u2019s business model of home delivery for absolutely anything and everything, was perfectly suited to the Covid-19 crisis \u2014 though in the longer term its model will prove fatally flawed, since it depends on trucking every single item to its customers, and the reason will become evident further down.\n\nThe catastrophic failure of so much small business in America through 2020 will provide the seeds for a rebirth of small businesses when the giants fall. A lot of equipment will be available at dimes on the dollar. Rents will be cheap. Enterprising people will have to be careful about where they decide to set up for new businesses: better Main Street than out on some empty strip-mall. Consolidation will be working in a different way \u2014 not to make companies bigger, but to bring many small businesses closer together in places people can get to without a car (what used to be known as a business district or downtown or Main Street). America is not going to need nearly as much shopping infrastructure as we had before 2020, and also not nearly as many restaurants. But we\u2019re going to need some of these things and done in a new way. I can also imagine new businesses that would have been unthinkable a year ago. At some point when Covid-19 exits the scene, people will want to get together with other people very badly. Think about opening a dance hall or a nightclub with live music, even a live performance theater.\n\nThe American economy had already entered a zone of dangerous structural fragility before Covid-19 stepped onstage. As Tim Morgan and Gail Tverberg argue so well in their respective blogs, the economy is an energy system that, in the advanced techno-industrial form, depends absolutely on fossil fuels, which have become a problem the past two decades, leading to the present inflection point bringing on de-growth, the onset of a long emergency, and what others call a fourth turning. Same things, really. We\u2019ve entered a state of contraction, and it\u2019s in the nature of large economic organisms to move from contraction to collapse fairly quickly, because the complex interconnections in their systems ramify and amplify each other\u2019s failures. The virus has made it all worse, and faster.\n\nOil\n\nHardly anyone paid any attention to the oil story this year with all the frightful distractions of Covid-19, the economic havoc of lockdowns, and the janky election. The oil story is probably more important than any other single factor in the current situation, and is largely responsible for America\u2019s economic mess. Everything in the USA runs on oil and our business model for doing that is broken. De-growth changes everything.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2008, we were on a downward slide with our conventional oil supply \u2014 the kind of oil where you just drill a pipe into the ground and the oil flows out, or, at worst, gets sucked out by a pump-jack \u2014 all-in-all, a simple procedure. In 2008, total US oil production was under 5-million barrels-a-day, down from the old production peak of just under 10-milliion b/d in 1970. And of course, our consumption kept going up to about 20-million b/d by 2008. So, we were importing most of our oil then.\n\nThat created terrible problems for our balance-of-payments in international trade, but we fudged that by pretending for decades that deficits don\u2019t matter, as Veep Dick Cheney famously put it. The result, via the recondite and pernicious operations of financialization \u2014 that is, replacing a production economy with one based on the sheer manipulation of money and its derivatives \u2014 was the 2008-9 Great Financial Crisis. The GFC was presaged in the summer of 2008 by the price of a barrel of oil reaching just under $150 \u2014 which badly strained what remained of real productive industry. The dynamic in play induced political authorities to quit regulating wild misconduct in finance and banking, as they attempted to replace productive industry with money games. These malfeasances played out most vividly in real estate and the \u201cinnovative\u201d securitized mortgage bonds that were gamed to a fare-the-well by the banks. The abstruse crimes have been chronicled widely elsewhere (e.g., my 2012 book Too Much Magic). But consider, also, that all the mortgage fraud of the early 2000s was based on the last gasp of the suburban expansion, and understand that suburbia was entirely at the mercy of mass motoring, which depended on affordable oil.\n\nSo, oil shot up to just under $150, the economy wobbled, the banks and the automobile companies had to be bailed out and central bank interventions became normalized, including zero interest Federal Reserve policy, a desperate legerdemain to keep up the appearance of a sound economic-financial gestalt. And that led to the \u201cshale oil miracle.\u201d\n\nIt was more a stunt than a miracle, really. First, you had this suite of techniques that could be employed to goose the last bit of oil from otherwise unproductive source rock. These included computerized horizontal drilling and the injection of fluids plus chemicals to fracture the impermeable rock and release the oil. This was \u201cfracking.\u201d It was not new but had not been scaled up into a major activity while the easier pickings were good. It was way different from the old simple method of drilling a pipe in the ground and letting it flow out of permeable rock. The old simple method cost about a half million dollars (in current dollars) per well to drill and start the oil flowing. Shale oil, with all its complications, cost between $6-12 million per well. The old 1960s conventional oil wells produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. The new shale wells produced maybe 100-odd barrels a day for the first year and they were done after four years. The depletion rate was horrendous.\n\nShale oil was made possible by the Federal Reserve\u2019s ultra-low-interest, easy lending policies. They made a lot of cheap capital available, and hundreds of billions migrated to the new shale oil plays in expectation that they would produce excellent steady revenues. Big institutional investors like pension funds and insurance companies especially were looking for reliable revenue with bond interest rates so low due to Fed policy. They thought they\u2019d be swimming in shale oil company dividends and revenue streams from loans to shale drillers that paid better than US treasury bonds. One thing for sure, they thought: America wasn\u2019t going to stop needing lots of oil. So, shale oil seemed like a sure thing. Except that after a few years, it turned out that nobody was making any money producing shale oil.\n\nIt just cost so damn much to get that stuff out of the ground. And the depletion rate was so savage that you had to drill and re-drill incessantly. And what was worse, the economy had evolved to the stage where there was no sweet spot for oil prices. Oil over $75 destroyed the business model for productive industrial activities that relied on cheap oil; while oil under $75 destroyed oil companies because they couldn\u2019t make a profit at the well head. The melodrama played out over ten years through several rounds of Fed Quantitative Easing (money creation from nowhere) and relentless run-ups of government deficits. The oil companies themselves were caught in a \u201cRed Queen syndrome\u201d (ref.: Alice Through the Looking Glass) in which they were producing as much and as fast as they could just to keep up their cash flow to make loan repayments, without generating any profits \u2014 and quite a few companies couldn\u2019t even keep up with their loan repayments, so shale was a total bust for them and they went bankrupt. It all came to a head in early 2020.\n\nJust before the Covid-19 virus hit, shale oil production stood at over 9 million barrels a day, with another roughly 4 million from conventional oil, offshore oil, for a grand total of nearly 13 million barrels a day in US oil production, a new record! That was 3 million b/d higher than the previous peak of 1970, at just under 10 million b/d. Quite a feat! Added to that was just under 5 million b/d in natural gas liquids. Daily US consumption was around 20 million b/d heading into 2020. It fell briefly during the initial Covid panic to around 15 million b/d and bounced back a little to around 18 million b/d in the fall of 2020. So, production appeared to be basically equal to our consumption.\n\nHowever, the quality of the oil skewed the equation of \u201coil independence.\u201d Shale oil tended to be ultra-light oil, composed mostly of gasoline-grade distillates. Fine, America uses a lot of gasoline because we drive everywhere and incessantly so. The trouble is, shale oil contains little of the crucial heavier distillates: diesel fuel, which the trucking industry and heavy machinery depends on, aviation fuel (basically kerosene), and bunker fuel, a heavy oil fuel for home heating and ships\u2019 engines. Neither did those nearly 5 million barrels a day of natural gas liquids, which were really only used for cutting heavy oil, which was mostly what the USA did not produce and was not well-equipped to refine. The bottom line was that the US had to swap a lot of gasoline to other countries to get heavier distillates to keep the economy going. It worked, but it was awkward and involved a tremendous amount of transport. So, America\u2019s oil situation coming out of 2019 was superficially stabile but fragile.\n\nBut entering 2020, shale oil production was in collapse. The lack of profitability finally caught up with the industry. Investors finally noticed that the shale oil producers couldn\u2019t make money. At one flukey point in the Covid-19 spring of 2020, the oil markets became so disordered by collapsing demand that oil on the futures market cratered to a surreal negative-$40 a barrel. It soon corrected to the positive-$30-40 range, which was not nearly enough for the shale oil business to turn a profit. Consequently, the companies could not get new financing to continue their \u201cRed Queen\u201d operations, and without new financing they could not keep up cash flow\u2026 and they crapped out. Thirty-six producers filed for bankruptcy in 2020, including Chesapeake, Oasis, Lonestar, Ultra, Whiting, and Chaparral. Oil field service companies that are subcontracted to perform the drilling and fracking have also gone bust.\n\nShale oil production fell by roughly 2.7 million b/d from March to May 2020, recovered a little at mid-year and stumbled again with the winter wave of the virus. Oil analyst Steve St. Angelo predicts that total US oil production (shale and everything else) will fall to between 9.5 and 10 million b/d in 2021, which would put us back to 1970 levels when the nation\u2019s population was just 205 million (compared to 330+ million today). So, that\u2019s a lot less oil-per-capita, to view it from another angle. Independent oil analyst Art Berman is predicting a more severe production crash by midyear 2021 to roughly half what it was at year-end 2019. Nafeez Ahmed, Director Institute for Policy Research & Development, is simply calling this the end of the oil age. Ahmed says it \u201cwill begin over the next 30 years, and continue through to the next century.\u201d\n\nI believe it will go down much quicker than that because falling production is so destructive to the business model of industrial society that it will induce gross economic, social, and political disorder. All that disorder will generate self-reinforcing feedback loops making a return to previous levels of comfort, convenience, prosperity, and order much less likely. The net effect will be a much lower standard-of-living among formerly \u201cadvanced\u201d nations, and also falling populations. We\u2019re just experiencing the beginning of that process with the destruction of America\u2019s middle-class. It is the essence of the long emergency. We just can\u2019t tell right now how far down these dynamics will drive us, and how fast. 2021 is likely to manifest intense disorder in the USA as people reel from the loss of small businesses, economic conditions deteriorate further, and political grievance gets amped up by institutional failure to resolve, or even address, our many problems and quandaries.\n\nAs for transitioning into a \u201csustainable economy\u201d powered by \u201crenewables\u201d such as solar and wind power, that just ain\u2019t going to happen \u2014 unless you\u2019re talking about oxen and firewood, and a human population about ten percent of what the planet currently carries. All our fantasies about a high-tech utopia driven by wind and sun depend on a fossil fuel economy to produce the hardware for it and then the replacement parts for the hardware, ad infinitum. It\u2019s not worth going into it further here, but if you want to see more elaborate arguments, they\u2019re in my recent book Living in the Long Emergency (BenBella Books, 2020).\n\nThe So-called Great Reset\n\nLife in the USA, and other \u201cadvanced\u201d nations will reset, but not in the way that most people blabbering about \u201cthe Great Reset\u201d think or say it will.\n\nSurely, there are groups, gangs, claques, and covens of people in the world who have some consensual agreement about how things might work, and how they would run them to their benefit, in their hypothetical ideal disposition of things. For instance, the so-called \u201cDavos Crowd.\u201d What are they? A convocation of bankers, market movers, politicians, business moguls, tech entrepreneurs, Hollywood catamites, black ops runners, and PR errand boys who have plenty of financial and political mojo in their own realms, but not enough collectively to carry out the kind of global coup that comprises the standard paranoid Great Reset fantasy. That they meet-up in an ultra-luxurious setting out of a James Bond movie every year stokes terrific fascination, envy, anger, and paranoia that they are capable of anything beyond a festival of ass-kissing, mutual self-congratulation, and status-jockeying, which are the actual activities at the Davos meet-up.\n\nFor another thing, in the USA, at least, there are too many pissed-off people with small arms, hardened by years of proffered bad faith and dishonesty from the political/media/higher-ed complex, to just bend over and take it up the back-door from a gang of seditious, would-be aristo-totalitarians with l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 dreams of nostalgie-de-la-boue Marxist redemption. If you have any doubt about how disruptive angry people with small arms and lots of ammo might be to condescending elites, just review the events in the Middle East the past twenty years and imagine those dynamics transferred to Kansas.\n\nWhat does the \u201creset\u201d fantasy supposedly include? A \u201cnew world order,\u201d a phantasm of a unified world government, which is preposterous because the macro-trend at this moment of history worldwide is the opposite of consolidation and centralization of power, but rather breakup, downscaling, and re-localization. Why? As you saw in the Econ chapter, because the scale, pitch, and range of all our activities must be reduced to survive in the post-industrial conditions of resource and capital scarcity. And it will happen whether we like it or not and despite anybody\u2019s objections.\n\nWhat else is in the Reset grab-bag? Supposedly a single world currency, also absurd for reasons already stated \u2014 unless you are talking about gold and silver, which may eventually become the universally-accepted medium of exchange (and store of value, index of price) if the post-industrial contraction is severe and destructive enough. But fuggeddabowt \u201cdigital currencies,\u201d especially in the USA because too many people are \u201cun-banked,\u201d or otherwise depend on cash-money in the informal \u201cgray\u201d economy of just-getting-by (and there will be a lot more of these types as the middle-class gets pounded further down into the mud), plus a large cohort of digitally-capable people just plain ornery about being herded into an IRS surveillance cul-de-sac \u2014 and the whole lot of them will fight like hell to prevent government-sponsored crypto-dollars from replacing what used to be considered money. And, if, in the unlikely event that rebellion fails, it\u2019s back to gold and silver by default \u2014 and that might literally mean by default.\n\nNow, I grant you that there are fer sure problems with all the major currencies, especially the USA dollar, and they are all liable to become worthless eventually for all the usual and traditional reasons. The US dollar is especially vulnerable since its status as the world\u2019s \u201creserve\u201d currency \u2014 a reliable medium of exchange in global trade \u2014 is no longer consistent with the true financial condition of our country, which is morbidly obese with debt that will never be repaid \u2014 a terminal case. There will eventually be some kind of default, either the straightforward way, by declaring nonpayment to bond-holders and creditors outright, or by sneakily engineering a hyper-inflation of the money supply to destroy the value of the dollar. If either of those events plays out, the nation will be thrust into serious social and political disorder, blame will get cast, people will get hurt, and it will be a while before the finer points of the social contract get pasted back together \u2014 such as any agreement to introduce a \u201cnew dollar\u201d of some kind to replace the ruined old one. By then, the old USA may not still be standing intact, and it would be up to states or regions to address the money issue.\n\nI don\u2019t believe it will be settled as a new digital money for reasons outlined above, but also because digital money is utterly dependent on the Internet, which, in turn, is utterly dependent on a reliable electric grid, and both systems are susceptible to going down in the kind of socio-political convulsion that would attend financial collapse. Not only would transactions become impossible, but records of money ownership \u2014 \u201cwallets,\u201d or files \u2014 could be permanently lost, wiping out fortunes. This obviously includes Bitcoin and things like it. Blockchain is only as strong as the chain, and without the Internet there\u2019s no chain at all. So, again, gold and silver must enter the picture, perhaps backing a paper currency, perhaps circulating as coin.\n\nIn the meantime of such a crisis, very little of daily life would come out the other end looking the way it used to in the years prior to 2020. We\u2019ll see a Great Reset, all right, but not some totalitarian gruel dished out to the plebes from the Davos steam-table or any other elite catering service. It will be an emergent, self-organizing phenomenon, from the ground up, in which everyday people will have to improvise new systems at the local level for getting food, arranging for shelter, and creating business activities around their most fundamental needs: food production, transport, trade, manufacturing, energy supplies, medical care, cleaning, building, et cetera.\n\nI\u2019ve been saying for a while that this might amount to \u201cgoing medieval.\u201d Could be better, could be worse. Well, there it is. There\u2019s your Great Reset for you. Stand by and prepare to scramble.\n\nThe Abyss Stares Back\n\nThe federal eviction moratorium passed by Congress with the spring 2020 onset of Covid-19 will expire at the end of January as things stand now, placing 30-million renters at risk of losing their dwellings. Another 28-million house-holders have been placed in a mortgage moratorium. What happens a month from now? Well, for one thing, don\u2019t overlook the brutal fact that these moratoria don\u2019t excuse anybody from having to pay all the back rent and back mortgage installments that were suspended for the year. The federal government just can\u2019t keep rolling that forward forever because it thunders through the banking system. If landlords don\u2019t get paid, they cannot pay their mortgages \u2014 and most rental real estate is mortgaged to allow for a coherent cash-flow, tax payment, and business model. Neither can the landlords pay their taxes to the municipalities (states and US government). The cities are especially harmed by collapsing tax revenue because they can\u2019t keep with infrastructure repair, can\u2019t cover pensions, or schools, the vicious cycle of urban decay.\n\nHow are people who have lost businesses and livelihoods going to come up with the money to make up these back payments. They probably will not. So far, there is no national discussion of that problem, but we\u2019re seeing the first signs of an emotional response in rent rebellions under the banner \u201ccancel rent.\u201d This quandary points to the likelihood of a campaign for the federal government to bail out renters and homeowners, and/or a campaign for the program that made its debut in the 2020 Democratic primaries, \u201cuniversal basic income\u201d (UBI). Either one of those has a fair chance of happening as America\u2019s economic collapse proceeds and politicians panic.\n\nThese programs won\u2019t work. As soon as they are bailed out for their old debts, the renters and home \u201cowners\u201d will start racking up new back-payments if they have not done enough to generate a regular income, or simply can\u2019t because the economy is so broken. And then what? Another bail out in six months? All the money creation to fuel that wheel of futility will only hasten the inflationary depreciation of the dollar as ever more money is created from thin air to make these bail-outs and hand-outs. The kind of UBI that was bandied about in the 2020 primaries, especially by candidate Andrew Yang, amounted to $1000-a-month. Most renters probably could not cover their monthly rents out of that, not to mention all the other costs of living. So then what? $5000-a-month? If you\u2019re going to give away large sums of money for nothing, why not just make every impoverished American a millionaire? (And then watch the price of a Dunkin\u2019 donut go up to $150.)\n\nA parallel crisis has also ripened in commercial real estate as companies adjust to their employees working from home and try to get out of their leases \u2013 or just bail if their leases are up for renewal. The office building may not be altogether a thing of the past, but it won\u2019t be like it was before 2020, and the problem is most acute in a place like New York or Chicago where midtown is chockablock with megastructures that went from being assets to liabilities virtually overnight. We have no idea what will become of them, but I doubt they will be retrofitted into apartments for two reasons: 1) the cost would be out-of-this-world, and 2) the apartment tower is just an accessory to the office tower, and if the office towers are obsolete, so are the apartment towers.\n\nThis leads to what I have been saying since I wrote Too Much Magic: our cities are going to contract substantially; the process is going to painful; and there will be battles over who gets to inhabit the districts that, for one reason or another, retain value \u2014 waterfronts, older small-scale, low-rise neighborhoods. Covid-19 plus riots-and-looting have prompted people-of-means to resettle hastily in the suburbs. But this trend is a head-fake. Facing the oil problems that we do, the suburbs will quickly follow the cities into disutility and dysfunction. The people who moved there the past year will discover that they made a major mistake, especially if they bought a house.\n\nThe more permanent shift will be to America\u2019s small cities and small towns, places scaled to the energy and capital resource realities coming down on us, including the need to live closer to where your food is grown.\n\nThis snowballing national existential fiasco certainly suggests the need to reorganize the American economy and the choices are pretty stark. The Democratic Party and the whole left-leaning side of the transect is inclined to attempt centralized control of economic activity in a way that strongly resembles the gigantic national experiments of the 20th century that went by the name of socialism. I mean\u2026 what else can you call it? It doesn\u2019t really exist anymore in practice, not even in China, which is now merely totalitarian racketeering state. The 20th century was a moment in history when everything really was growing in scale, and with it came a wish for controlling all that by national governments. It was tried in many places and everywhere it was tried it ended in tyranny, hardship, and mass murder\n\nThings have changed. They have reversed. Things are contracting. So, the other choice we have is to go with that flow, scale down the things we do and the terrain we occupy and the range of things we think we can control. That will ultimately be the only choice, of course, since the urge for a new statist socialism is against the current impulse of history, and therefore against nature. It will fail and then we will have to get with the program that the zeitgeist actually offers.\n\nWokesterism\n\nSometimes societies just lose their shit and go crazy and that is kind of what happened to America in 2020. The distress had been building for years, especially since the GFC of 2008-9 when the middle-class began dissolving in earnest. Now, their grown children discern that the future is going to be very unlike the recent past, and that their programmed hopes and dreams do not jibe with what that future actually requires of them: rigor, realism, earnestness, and rectitude. It\u2019s too much for them. It\u2019s too painful. And they\u2019re not ready for it. They retreat into fantasy, cynicism, and ambiguity. So instead of virtue, we got virtue-signaling and, in adults who ought to know better, the kind of bratty behavior you\u2019d expect from 13-year-old girls.\n\nThe ground for this was prepared by a society that opted to turn most of its important institutionalized activities into rackets, most particularly, higher education, which entered a late-stage metastasizing expansion fed by government guaranteed loan racketeering. The loan racket allowed the universities and colleges to jack up their tuition extravagantly, which prompted them to regard their debt-burdened, overpaying students as customers, which evolved into just plain pandering to their every wish.\n\nAlready in place, as a legacy of the 1960s, was a faculty of crusaders and activists in revolt against the bourgeois indignities of their own comfortable lives, making common cause with all other imagined \u201cvictims of oppression\u201d as a form of careerist theater. They concocted curricula of bullshit disciplines for various victim-identity cohorts to monetize their grievance obsessions, and it all worked splendidly until Covid-19 ripped through the campuses and started blowing up the whole business model. And now college enrollments are headed down an estimated 20 percent for 2021, and an awful lot of the not-so-well-endowed schools will be going out of business, with even better-endowed schools soon to follow.\n\nAnother thing happened in parallel to the grievance hysterias on campus. The half-century-long civil rights campaign that went up a dead-end with all the family-destroying social services policies of the late 20thcentury, became such a manifestly embarrassing failure with an ever-growing hostile and dangerous underclass, that, in abject shame and disappointment, all of white liberaldom had to come up with an excuse for that failure, which finally fluoresced as Critical Race Theory with its hobgoblin-in-chief, systemic racism.\n\nHence: Black Lives Matter, based on the fantasy that white policemen were engaged in a genocide against people of color. Really, what you had with Trayvon Martin of Sanford, FLA, Michael Brown of Ferguson, MO, Tamir Rice, of Cleveland OH, and a long line of insta-martyrs, was a series of extremely ambiguous incidents at best, and, at worst, episodes of teens with poor impulse control acting out in ways very likely to get them into big trouble. And then, finally, with the maddening Covid-19 upon the land, and temperatures rising around Memorial Day, came George Floyd, middle-aged ex-con (home invasion, armed robbery, etc.), sometime porn star, hustler, a drug abuser who was \u201cturning his life around\u201d in Minneapolis, suddenly trapped under the knee of officer Derek Chauvin\u2026.\n\nBlack Lives Matter can be simply understood as a well-funded hustle, and by \u201chustle\u201d I mean a program for dishonestly extracting goods from others, a crude \u201cstreet\u201d variation of a racket. BLM also features a patina of moral fakery, namely its supposed \u201cMarxist\u201d credo \u2014 an attempt to appear intelligent and political where it is actually merely criminal. In reality, it\u2019s just a destructive force, a vehicle for punishing its perceived enemies, especially the police who are supposedly (but not in reality) perpetrating racist genocide. This gets to the heart of the Wokesterism more generally in all its aspects from Critical Race Theory to cancel culture to the #Me Too game. Its animating purpose is coercion, the wish to push other people around, to find excuses to punish them, and to do it for the sheer sadistic pleasure of watching them squirm, suffer, lose their livelihoods, and perish. That\u2019s it. The rest is sheer bullshit.\n\nIn the new year, the ongoing economic carnage will be so severe that the nation may not have time for the finer points of Woke theory and philosophy, or the patience to hear tedious explications of identitarian complaints. Women will have to stop pretending to be an alt version of men, and begin conceiving of some plausible role for themselves as a complementary division of the human race in a new and harsh struggle to thrive. Woke cries of \u201cracist, racist, racist\u201d will no longer be greeted with supplication, apologies, and cosseting. Claims of special victimhood will be laughed out of the public meetings. For the first time in decades in the USA, everyone will have to pull his-or-her own weight, and shut the fuck up about it. Hard times will shake America out of its squishy fantasies and concentrate millions of minds on looking after their basic needs without mommy-hugs, participation trophies, or affirmative action line-jumping.\n\nAntifa, a Woke auxiliary with a really bad attitude, spent most of the Covid-19 year as a social space for youth meet-ups as all the usual social venues \u2014 campuses, bars, coffee shops, parties, concerts, etc \u2014 all got locked-down. In Seattle, WA, Portland, OR, Minneapolis, MN, Philly, PA, and NYC, NY, where feckless politicians forced police to stand down, or crippled them with sanctions against the use of force, or just fired a bunch of them wholesale, Antifa rioters discovered that it was especially fun to play adult versions of capture-the-flag or ring-a-leevio on warm summer nights with the cops. They got to wear groovy street-fighting outfits and wield umbrellas against gas attacks, and the hormonal young men showboated acts of derring-do with fireworks, skateboards, baseball bats, and, more than once, alas, firearms. If they happened to get rounded up by the police, the local DA\u2019s let them go and many returned to the fun riots time after time, all summer long.\n\nA lot of property got damaged, statues of famous Americans got pulled down, spray-painted, peed-on, busted up, decapitated. Businesses having a hard enough time staying afloat under the Covid lockdowns, had their storefronts smashed, equipment and merchandise looted. Fifty years from now, wrinkled old Antifas will recall how romantic it was. In 2021, the public will lose patience with any further Antifa antics in the streets. They will just get their little umbrellas shredded and their asses kicked, and they\u2019ll go weee-weee-weee back to whatever the equivalent of a crash-pad is nowadays, or to mommy\u2019s basement. We\u2019ll also learn a thing or two about who was funding Antifa in 2020, paying for their airplane tickets to stage their fun riots in city after city, and make sure they were well-supplied with pallets of bricks, Roman candles, and bear spray. Many of today\u2019s Antifas will be tomorrow\u2019s agricultural laborers. Having spent their youth rioting, drugging, playing with their gender presentation and their phones, they won\u2019t be qualified for anything else.\n\nChinese Fire Drills with Russian Dressing\n\nDonald Trump attempted to put the schnitz on the established order of things between the US and China, which had steadily turned against our own national interest. For a couple of decades, they sent us cheap manufactured goods and we sent them US treasury bond paper. China liked that arrangement well enough, but it really wasn\u2019t working out so well for us. Having given away our manufacturing sector to them, and everybody else in East Asia, our working class no longer had decent-paying jobs and were increasingly strapped to buy all that cheap stuff made in China, even at low, low Walmart prices. So, Mr. Trump made a stink about it and slapped tariffs on Chinese goods, and they have lately been dumping US treasury paper instead of loading up on it as before. They still hold over a trillion dollars\u2019 worth, and they can\u2019t dump a whole bunch of it at once without destroying its value. And we still buy a lot of stuff from China, though the relationship is now very fraught.\n\nSome say we\u2019re at war with China, that it\u2019s a new kind of war, an information and infiltration war. Just what and who does China own in the USA? The American people are starting to find out. Gawd knows what else our unreliable Intel Community knows. Perhaps China owns our CIA now. Perhaps that\u2019s why Mr. Trump has been so busy stripping away the CIA\u2019s various perqs and capacities. We\u2019ve learned for sure that they bought and paid for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, through a series of lucrative business deals made by his son, Hunter, with a subsidiary of China\u2019s own Intel Agency. Nobody seems to care about that at the moment \u2014 but maybe they will care more as we approach his hypothetical inauguration.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that China put a bid on Congressman Eric Swalwell (D-CA), a majority member of the House Intel Committee. They sent a little fortune cookie named Fang Fang over to California some years ago when Mr. Swalwell was a member of the Dublin, CA, city council, and she hung with him for years, bundling campaign money and helping him rise into a congressional seat. He was rumored to be playing hide-the-winter-melon with her, for years. Was he owned? Nobody seems to care for now. Perhaps that will change.\n\nAnd, of course, we learned some time ago that Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) had a Chinese (national) chauffeur and go-fer for twenty freakin\u2019 years \u2014 including her years as chair of the Senate Intel Committee. He vamoosed to China when his identity as a spy was revealed. Nobody cares. That\u2019s what a sloppy-ass country we\u2019ve become.\n\nChina, apparently, has thousands upon thousands of carefully placed agents throughout America, especially in big academic research centers and American tech companies and even the news media. Reports say that a Chinese company purchased a 75-percent interest in Dominion Voting Systems for $400-million from Staple Street Capital in October 2020 in a shadowy deal run through the Swiss Bank UBS. It has been demonstrated that Dominion voting machines used in the recent national US elections, were connected to the Internet, though, by law, they are not allowed to be connected. Weird, a little bit. Connected to whom? So far, nobody seems to care.\n\nOh, and there was China\u2019s Lunar New Year gift to America almost a year ago: Covid-19.\n\nThanks, China. What do we actually know about how that went down? Apparently, they are busy as I write destroying virus samples in the Wuhan lab.\n\nWill this so far informational and economic war between China and the US heat up and become a different kind of war? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much in it for China to go that route. Anyway, they\u2019ve got their hands full waiting to see if their bought-and-paid-for errand boy, Mr. Biden, actually becomes president and also perhaps waiting to see exactly how the USA falls apart in the coming year. They will lose a lot of customers for patio furniture and sundry other stuff, but then they won\u2019t have to worry about us monitoring all their activity elsewhere around the world, where, let\u2019s face it, they have a lot going on. The main thing is, China is nearly as fragile as we are, only in different ways. They don\u2019t have whole lot of oil reserves, and they\u2019re burning almost 13-million barrels a day, of which they produce close to 5-million and import the rest. Not a great situation, and not appreciably better than our own. Their banking system is at least as janky as ours, probably worse, since their banks only have to answer to the CCP and they can paper-over any financial sucking chest wound. A global depression could create serious unemployment problems for them, and hence political pressure on and within the CCP. For 2021. If, by some chance, Donald Trump ends up back in the White House, things could go a bit more non-linear.\n\nReports emerged only days ago that President Xi Jinping will be undergoing brain surgery for a worsening aneurysm. They imply a power struggle in the CCP to ensue in the event that the surgery doesn\u2019t turn out well. I can\u2019t confirm these rumors, but there it is\u2026 just sayin\u2019\u2026.\n\nRussia appears best positioned to sit out the economic disorders of the West and the discontents of China. Russia has already been through a traumatic economic and political collapse and emerged much lightened, streamlined, and viable. Due to punitive US sanctions, she has had to develop an import-replacement economy, supplying more of her own needs. She has about twice the proven oil reserves as the USA and less than half our population. She has been steadily acquiring gold reserves and has been making noises about establishing a gold-backed currency \u2014 which would be a real novelty in a world of fiat junk money. She has a well-educated and relatively homogenous population of capable people who have recovered psychologically from the 75-year-long political mind-fuck of communism. She has an arsenal of world-beating hypersonic nuclear weapons. She has rational and intelligent political leadership. And Russia just passed a law stating that anyone who brings false #MeToo accusations against another citizen faces five years in prison. One looks on in awe!\n\nEurope\n\nAchhhhh. Fugeddabowdit. No oil. No mojo. Buried in debt. Failing social safety nets. Over a million hostile Muslim immigrants looking to burn the joint down. In 2021, the EU will break down and states will scramble desperately to shore up their economies. They will not succeed. Disorders follow and governments will fall. Angela Merkel waves goodby to das volk. Boris Johnson faces a no confidence vote in parliament. Macron survives and gets very tough, but France grows poor and bitter. Everybody starts saying nice things about Victor Orban.\n\nThere\u2019s the whole shootin\u2019 match. Forgive me for leaving out only about ten thousand other topics and issues, including climate change, about which I will only say: believe it or not, we\u2019ve got more urgent things to worry about.

         "Prediction_result":1,
         "content":"Big Oil, King Coal, Big Chemical, Big Tech and Big Pharma are titans of a Deep State cartel that is driving our country down the road to plutocracy and environmental apocalypse. We must unite to fight them \u2014 and not each other.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the introduction to \u201cClimate in Crisis: Who\u2019s Causing It, Who\u2019s Fighting It and How We Can Reverse It Before It\u2019s Too Late,\u201d by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Dick Russell.\n\n\u201cTo greed, all nature is insufficient.\u201d \u2014 Seneca\n\nLong before it turned its attention to systematically destroying the planet, the carbon industry set its sights on destroying American democracy and on bulldozing our values.\n\nThe term \u201cDeep State\u201d is one of those toxic phrases that highlights and exacerbates the widening chasm between Democrats and Republicans. Ironically, polarization is a key strategic objective for the sinister cabal that the phrase describes.\n\nRight-wing populists use the term Deep State to characterize the supposed authors of the cavalcade of social and economic demotions that have fatally wounded America\u2019s dwindling middle class. The obliteration has been so systematic and complete that it seems obvious to them that it is planned.\n\nIn their view, a group of secretive aristocrats, led by George Soros and the late David Rockefeller, manipulate shadowy institutions like the Federal Reserve and the Council on Foreign Relations in order to shift wealth and power to billionaire elites, with the ultimate aim of achieving \u201cWorld Government.\u201d\n\nTo weaken the American character, these secretive aristocrats\u2019 allies among the \u201cHollywood Elites\u201d have deliberately cheapened our culture by infiltrating TV and film with sex and violence. These elites are purposefully undermining American democracy, subverting constitutional rights and waging economic and cultural war on Main Street America, our democracy and national sovereignty.\n\nSince all those cohorts have devoted energies to averting climate change, the global warming debate has become a prominent feature of these cosmologies. Decarbonization is seen as yet another attack on the U.S. economy, and a ploy for One-World Government.\n\nLike every conspiracy theory, this one has nuggets of truth.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, dismiss talk of a Deep State as the ravings of deluded right-wing conspiracy theorists. They point out that Hollywood czars like Tom Hanks and Barbra Streisand are a great distance from real power, while arguing that Wall Street itself pushed sex and violence onto our TV screens. Pornography, after all, sells sex.\n\nDavid Rockefeller died in 2017, and the remaining Rockefeller family members have greatly diversified interests and little demonstrated appetite for One-World Government. Democrats point out that George Soros is 90 years old, and manages vast investments in oil and gas with annual profits that dwarf his relatively tiny contributions to climate change activism. His Council on Foreign Relations is an anemic think tank, its members mainly jockeying to burnish resum\u00e9s and rub shoulders with a doddering Henry Kissinger. The council akes no position on foreign policy issues and mostly publishes informational white papers that gather dust.\n\nBut the Deep State does exist. It has already obliterated the middle class and has democracy on the ropes. The real power behind the curtain is a conglomeration of corporations \u2014 coal, oil, chemical, steel and pharmaceutical, recently joined by telecom, Big Tech/Big Data \u2013\u2013 all bound, in a web of corruption, to our global military-intelligence apparatus.\n\nIt is this collaboration of modern Robber Barons that is making war on democracy, civil rights and the lower classes, while driving our country down the road to plutocracy and environmental apocalypse.\n\nThis conglomeration has declared war on America\u2019s democracy and freedoms. Anyone who doubts that the Deep State exists should read the myriad histories of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), including Tim Weiner\u2019s \u201cLegacy of Ashes,\u201d David Talbot\u2019s \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Chessboard\u201d and James Douglass\u2019s \u201cJFK and the Unspeakable.\u201d\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller laid the groundwork for the conglomeration with his ruthless drive for monopoly control of the world oil supply. (His company, Standard Oil \u2014 now ExxonMobil \u2014 controlled 90% of the U.S. oil supply). The pharmaceutical cartel is the offspring of Rockefeller\u2019s U.S. petroleum and coal tar industries and Third Reich chemists, who were deeply incriminated in the Holocaust and the Nazi war effort.\n\nSubscribe to The Defender - It\u2019s Free!

His philanthropy focused on his philosophy of promoting petroleum-based pharmaceuticals and marginalizing the previously popular alternative medicines: osteopathy, homeopathy, natural remedies and plant medicines.\n\nFor decades, the Rockefeller family owned some 80% of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Today, the Rockefeller Empire \u2014 in tandem with JP Morgan Chase \u2014 continues to own half the pharmaceutical industry in the U.S.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller\u2019s grandson, David, with his ties to the oil and pharmaceutical industries and international banking and his friendship with Allen Dulles, was certainly among the Deep State\u2019s Grand Panjandrums.\n\nDavid Rockefeller used his close relationship with the CIA, initially through Dulles, and his position as a director and then chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, to wage war on nationalist movements and representative democracies around the globe whenever they threatened the profits of his oil, mineral, chemical, pharmaceutical or banking interests.\n\nAll of these histories reveal Big Carbon as the conspiracy\u2019s center of gravity.\n\nThe CIA and the military nurtured a long cozy relationship with King Coal and Big Oil. Since the abolition of slavery, the Navy\u2019s replacement of sailboat fleets with fossil fuel-driven transportation and the introduction of petroleum-based pharmaceuticals, American wars have been, to a greater or lesser extent, strategic struggles over control of coal ports, shipping routes and oil fields.\n\nAmerica\u2019s first great foreign excursion was Cuba\u2019s War of Liberation. In 1898, America\u2019s Yellow Press appealed to the nation\u2019s idealism to drum up popular support for U.S. intervention, purportedly to support Cuban revolutionaries in their struggle for independence from Spain. To create a pretext for intervention, Deep State militarists staged the \u201cfalse flag\u201d scuttling of the battleship, the USS Maine in Havana Harbor, and blamed the sinking on Spain.\n\nTheir true objective became clear soon after Cuba\u2019s independence fighters achieved victory over Spain.\n\nDeep State militarists robbed the new nation of its most important port, expropriating Guantanamo Bay as a Naval coal terminal. A century later, Guantanamo, the symbol of America\u2019s abandonment of its revulsion for imperialism, became the situs for where America rebuffed its seminal revulsion against torture.\n\nToday, Guantanamo Bay stands as a kind of \u201canti-Statue of Liberty\u201d \u2014 a hemispheric symbol of the surrender of fundamental American values to the Deep State military-industrial complex, with its devouring hunger for carbon and its ambition for authoritarian control.\n\nAfter Cuba, protecting American oil and coal resources and ports became a raison d\u2019\u00eatre for an endless parade of new American wars and interventions.\n\nA nation\u2019s political structure tends to reflect its economic organization. When major industries are owned and controlled by a small group of wealthy individuals, the nation itself becomes economically stratified and tyrannical.\n\nCoal and oil are authoritarian industries. They are highly capitalized and rely on ruthless control of real estate and resources. While most nations declare that their oil resources are publicly owned, in practice, poorer citizens rarely share in petroleum profits. Large multinationals, frequently allied with local oligarchs, invariably and systematically find ways to steal and monopolize these resources.\n\nThe term \u201coil curse\u201d describes the nearly universal dynamic by which the governments of nations or states with rich oil reserves invariably devolve into highly militarized and despotic organs that are brutal and dictatorial.\n\nOil-dependent economies generally foster giant wealth gaps between rich and poor and violent totalitarian governance. The strategic relevance of oil and steel make these industries natural allies of the military and intelligence apparatus.\n\nIn 1954, the CIA\u2019s director, Allen Dulles, overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran, after the country\u2019s beloved Prime Minister, Mohammad Mossadegh \u2014 the first democratically elected head of state in Persia\u2019s 4,000-year history \u2014 committed the \u201ccrime\u201d of threatening to nationalize oil fields controlled by BP and Texaco. (Texaco had formerly been Dulles\u2019s client at the white-shoe law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell.)\n\nDulles installed the Shah to rule Iran and to protect the financial interests of his petroleum company client. Seventy years later, the entire world is still suffering from the blowback of that coup. The Iran Hostage Crisis of 1979 (precipitated when David Rockefeller and his crony, Henry Kissinger, pressured President Jimmy Carter to host the deposed Shah of Iran in the U.S. in order to protect Chase Manhattan\u2019s assets); the rise of militant Islam; the Afghanistan, Iraq and Syrian wars (which flooded Europe with displaced refugees, undermining Europe\u2019s unity and democracies); and our continued enmity with Iran, a nation that, in every other respect, should be our closest Middle East ally \u2014 are all blowback from that anti-democratic coup.\n\nThe founders recognized that America could not be both an imperial power abroad and a constitutional democracy at home. It is a seminal axiom of American foreign policy that our democratic government should not embroil America in foreign wars. President John Quincy Adams summarized the consensus of the founders, when he declared:\n\n\u201c[America] goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. She will commend the general cause by the countenance of her voice, and the benign sympathy of her example.\u201d\n\nBut the American carbon titans successfully overwhelmed these qualms and deployed the U.S. military as their private army, expanding its reach to protect Big Carbon\u2019s global interests.\n\nAllen Dulles helped his oil-fueled Deep State cabal to engineer America\u2019s departure from its traditional principle of non-intervention. My grandfather picked our family\u2019s 60-plus-year fistfight with the CIA in 1954, when President Eisenhower appointed him to a commission, chaired by former President Herbert Hoover, to investigate the CIA.\n\nSubscribe to The Defender - It\u2019s Free!

Yet the Hoover Commission found that the CIA was working, in league with petroleum companies, in direct opposition to official U.S. State Department policy, and regularly engaged in conduct antithetical to U.S. values.\n\nFollowing the thinking of President Adams, my grandfather believed that America could not be at once an imperial power and a constitutional democracy. He was angry and disgusted to learn that Dulles and his agency were overthrowing governments, disrupting elections, bribing politicians and undermining democracy around the globe in service to Big Oil and mining companies, as well as industrial/chemical agriculture.\n\nThe CIA orchestrated changing other countries\u2019 governments 72 times during the Cold War, affecting nearly one-third of the nations on Earth.\n\nI was in Chile in 1973, during the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat orchestrated by the CIA and David Rockefeller for the sole purpose of protecting U.S. telecom (ITT), banking (Chase), oil (Texaco), chemical (DuPont and Dow), food (PepsiCo Inc) and mining interests (Anaconda) \u2014 all threatened with nationalization by President Salvador Allende. I was fired upon \u2014 and nearly killed \u2014 by an army patrol as I struggled on foot across the Andes to Argentina. I was very conscious of the key role played by David Rockefeller and the U.S. Telecom behemoth ITT Corporation (International Telephone and Telegraph).\n\nStrategic lust for oil and the need to protect oil infrastructure motivated most of the CIA\u2019s interventions. CIA spooks and paramilitary units often worked hand-in-hand with mercenaries and private armies, which American oil companies paid, armed and trained.\n\nForeign warlords and politicians, fattening on oil company payrolls, routinely sold out the interests of their own nations (and murdered their own citizens) in furtherance of petroleum company ambitions. They financed and trained tens of thousands of oil industry personnel throughout the Middle East as paramilitaries, to fight off the Soviets and destroy oil infrastructure to prevent its capture in the event of Soviet invasion.\n\nAccording to biographer David Talbot, Dulles was incapable of distinguishing the U.S. national interests from the interests of his former oil industry clients. In fact, U.S .national interests took a distant back seat to shareholder profits.\n\nMy grandfather recommended the disbandment of the CIA\u2019s \u201cPlans\u201d division. He feared that the dangerous alliance of military and intelligence apparatus with oil industry fat cats would have disastrous consequences for America\u2019s democracy and our global reputation, potentially turning America into a National Security State. He recognized that the large oil corporations have no loyalty to America, much less to our core values.\n\nA statement by Exxon CEO Lee Raymond, during a 1998 ExxonMobil meeting, confirmed my grandfather\u2019s suspicions about the essential lack of patriotism among oil men: \u201cI\u2019m not a U.S. company,\u201d stated Raymond, \u201cand I don\u2019t make decisions based on what is good for the U.S.\u201d\n\nIt is no accident that the Deep State kingpin, Charles Koch (founder of Koch Industries, the largest privately owned oil company in the world), made his fortune by building refineries for the homicidal communist dictator Joseph Stalin. Koch and his sons deployed billions of ill-gotten dollars to create an infrastructure of Deep State think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, tasking them with the job of creating the philosophical underpinnings for the domination of America\u2019s democracy by corporations and militarists.\n\nOn my seventh birthday, January 17, 1961, three days before my uncle John F. Kennedy\u2019s (JFK) inauguration as America\u2019s 35th president, outgoing president Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered the greatest speech of his career, warning Americans against the Deep State, which he called the \u201cmilitary-industrial complex.\u201d\n\nEisenhower cautioned that the cartel could destroy our democracy:\n\n\u201cThis conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence \u2014 economic, political, even spiritual \u2014 is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government\u2026 [W]e must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.\u201d\n\nEisenhower went on:\n\n\u201cIn the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\u201d\n\nEisenhower cautioned that Americans must learn to recognize, and guard against, all the milestones of tyranny:\n\n\u201cWe must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of a huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.\u201d\n\nOn the same day as Eisenhower\u2019s speech, just days before my uncle took the oath of office, Belgian intelligence spies \u2014 with the support of Allen Dulles\u2019s CIA \u2014 murdered the Congo\u2019s charismatic leader, Patrice Lumumba.\n\nAs a U.S. senator, JFK had used his position as chair of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs to support Lumumba and other anti-colonial leaders. Dulles was disdainful of my uncle\u2019s sympathies for African liberation movements and, in particular, his admiration for Lumumba.\n\nDulles wanted to commit this murder before JFK took office. The Congo ranked among the world\u2019s richest nations measured by its mineral wealth and natural resources, including its abundant oil fields. U.S. and European mineral, and petroleum companies were salivating at the prospect of exploiting tribal tensions to cut the newly liberated nation into bite-sized parcels that they could easily devour and rule.\n\nThey knew Lumumba was the only Congolese leader with the charisma and popularity to unite all of Congo\u2019s rival warring tribes.\n\nLumumba\u2019s murder shocked and saddened my uncle. He would not live to learn of the CIA\u2019s role in orchestrating that hit for Big Oil and the Deep State.\n\nBeginning in 1958, Dulles had worked with Eisenhower\u2019s bellicose vice president, Richard Nixon, plotting to oust Cuba\u2019s newly ascended revolutionary leader, Fidel Castro, who earlier that year had deposed brutal dictator Fulgencio Batista and his mafia cronies.\n\nNixon and Dulles persuaded Texaco to shut down its critical Cuban refinery and United Fruit Company \u2014 another of Allen Dulles\u2019s former clients \u2014 to cease exports of Cuban sugar, so as to crush their economy and destroy Castro\u2019s revolutionary regime.\n\nCastro and his lieutenant, Che Guevara, were avowed Marxists, but their revolutionary colleagues embraced a wide range of competing ideologies that were mainly democratic and anti-Batista.\n\nSubscribe to The Defender - It\u2019s Free!

The Soviets agreed to rescue the besieged Cubans by trading Russian oil for Cuban sugar.\n\nThe CIA retaliated with the aerial bombing of a Havana shopping center. That illegal CIA act of terror gave Castro the political strength to declare his new regime communist for the first time. He made the announcement at the funeral of the CIA\u2019s victims.\n\nIn 1989, Castro told me, \u201cThe United States facilitated Cuba into embracing Marxism.\u201d\n\nWhen JFK denied the CIA\u2019s request to transport the \u201cBay of Pigs\u201d brigade in naval vessels, Dulles\u2019s former client, United Fruit Company, provided the CIA with a fleet of ships to support the invasion. When Castro\u2019s overwhelming forces predictably trapped the brigade on the beach at Playa Gir\u00f3n, JFK refused the CIA\u2019s request for air support by U.S. forces.\n\nDulles had assured JFK that U.S. military intervention would, under no conditions, be necessary. JFK realized that Dulles and other CIA officials and military brass had lied to him. He told his closest advisors, \u201cI want to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.\u201d\n\nJFK fired Allen Dulles after the Bay of Pigs, but Dulles continued to steer the CIA remotely and would return to government in 1963 to lead the Warren Commission investigation of JFK\u2019s death. He used that post to conceal the CIA\u2019s deep involvement in JFK\u2019s assassination.\n\nMy uncle and father spent their careers \u2014 and gave their lives \u2014 to the task of saving democracy from the Deep State cartel. They enraged Dallas oilmen by their efforts to revoke the Oil Depletion Allowance and other tax subsidies, which then provided corporate welfare worth $185 million, annually, in handouts to America\u2019s petroleum corporations.\n\nTexas oil producers paid zero income tax on 27.5% of their taxable income. A handful of powerful Dallas oilmen, most notably Clint Murchison, H. L. Hunt, Sid Richardson and D. H. Byrd, were making millions from the allowance. Byrd alone had a $30 million annual income (in the 1960s) and paid no federal taxes. These Welfare Cowboys all had close connections with the CIA.\n\nBig Steel also had a natural alliance with the Pentagon. In 1962, JFK mediated a fierce wage dispute between the United Steelworkers Union and the 12 largest steel companies. The president intended to hold inflation in check by fighting the wage/price spiral. His delicate negotiations led to an extraordinary agreement: workers acquiesced to a wage freeze and the steel companies agreed to freeze steel prices.\n\nShortly after signing the agreement, U.S. Steel CEO, Roger Blough, came to the Oval Office to announce that Big Steel was committing a double-cross. The top six steel companies were violating the agreement and unilaterally raising prices by $6/ton (3.5 percent). Jack told Blough, \u201cYou are making a big mistake.\u201d He then ordered the Pentagon to move shipbuilding contracts from the noncompliant companies to smaller companies that had not raised prices.\n\nMy father, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (RFK), sent FBI agents to raid the big six steel company offices and to cart out their filing cabinets on dollies. His deputies told the steel executives to expect prosecutions on tax evasion and antitrust activities. It was the strongest pushback by a U.S. president against corporate power since Andrew Jackson fought the banks.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal denounced JFK for his naked power play against Big Business. Wall Street and the Deep State never forgave him. But that was only the beginning of Camelot\u2019s war on the Deep State.\n\nJFK defended Rachel Carson, whose book, \u201cSilent Spring,\u201d resulted in the banning of DDT, against Monsanto and the chemical conglomerates.\n\nHe sent Pentagon and CIA spooks into apoplexy when he refused to dispatch combat troops to Laos, Vietnam or Cuba.\n\nWhen he proposed d\u00e9tente with Khrushchev and Castro, Nelson Rockefeller accused JFK of treason. Jack signed the nuclear test ban treaty that the oil industry violently opposed \u2014 petroleum companies were America\u2019s largest producers of uranium, and they feared that peace would undermine their business model.\n\nMy Uncle Jack died two months after signing the Atmospheric Test Ban treaty, and 14 weeks after signing National Security Order 267, which ordered all U.S. advisors out of Vietnam by December 1965.\n\nJFK\u2019s death saved hundreds of millions of dollars for Texas oilmen by permanently deferring his plan to repeal the Oil Depletion Allowance.\n\nMy father\u2019s first instinct was that the CIA had murdered his brother. Less than two years later, Lyndon Baines Johnson ordered close to 250,000 U.S .combat troops into Vietnam, converting that country\u2019s civil conflict into an American War, in which more than 58,000 Americans and millions of Vietnamese would die.\n\nIn 1968, my father died during a presidential campaign waged against the war machine. He promised he would end the Vietnam War on the day he took his oath of office. He told his writer friend, Pete Hamill, that he meant to break up the CIA. Three weeks before his murder, he publicly acknowledged that he intended to reopen the investigation of his brother\u2019s assassination.\n\nMy father\u2019s death was one of five great national tragedies \u2013\u2013 the assassinations of JFK and Martin Luther King Jr.; the Vietnam War; 9/11; and COVID-19 \u2014 that allowed the men who want permanent war to transform America, which was once the world\u2019s exceptional democracy, into a National Security State.\n\nJFK and RFK dedicated their careers to preserving American democracy and idealism. One of their defining struggles was against the Deep State, and in particular the clawing power of Big Carbon. My own career has continued this tradition.\n\nIn the 1970s, Exxon, formerly Standard Oil, employed the world\u2019s most brilliant carbon scientists to understand every stage of oil production. The company prided itself on knowing more about the fate of the carbon molecule than any individual, corporation or government on Earth. Internal documents, created in the years following my father\u2019s death and recently made public, show that those scientists warned Exxon that business as usual would melt the polar ice caps, cause sea levels to rise and trigger cataclysmic climate change.\n\nExxon CEO Raymond described \u201cso-called global climate change\u201d as \u201cthe issue that perhaps poses the greatest long-term threat to our industry.\u201d\n\nRather than change its business model to save humanity, Exxon and its carbon cronies invested half a billion dollars in a four-decade campaign of lies and deception to gull the public into believing the absurd: that climate change is a hoax.\n\nA century earlier, one of my father\u2019s favorite poets, Rudyard Kipling, described such deception as truth being \u201ctwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools.\u201d\n\nBig Oil\u2019s Deep State cronies \u2013\u2013 the intelligence apparatus, the military-industrial complex and some mainstream media who take cues from oil and automobile advertisers \u2013\u2013 abetted this venal campaign.\n\nTwo forces drive democracy: money and political intensity. The Deep State has money, but its mission \u2014 to further enrich and empower the wealthiest 0.001 percent \u2014 is not a potent vessel for populism. Instead, it relies on so-called \u201cwedge\u201d or \u201cculture war\u201d issues to recruit foot soldiers. Steel, Oil and Pharma deploy front groups and PR flaks, using all the alchemies of demagoguery: dog-whistle racism, bigotry against immigrants and people of color, and invocations to patriotism and Christianity, in order to engage those whites who still feel alienated by the Civil Rights laws of the 1960s.\n\nThe Wall Street fat cats, the power brokers and PR flaks talk openly about \u201cgulling the rubes\u201d in their rural redoubts, winning their loyalties with palaver of abortion and the Three Gs: God, guns and gays. In the words of Christian Coalition President Ralph Reed, \u201cThey write the checks, and they get the joke.\u201d\n\nThese cohorts have used their money and political power to engineer for themselves obscene subsidies and tax breaks. (Exxon, the wealthiest company on Earth during the 1990s, paid virtually no federal taxes.) According to the World Bank, Big Carbon receives annual subsidies of $5.4 trillion globally and $655 billion in the U..S \u2014 more than we spend on our military and10 times our education budget.\n\nUsing political clout, the carbon incumbents have written the laws that regulate energy in America to reward the dirtiest, filthiest, most tyrannical and warmongering fuels from Hell, rather than the cheap, clean, green, democratic and patriotic fuels from Heaven.\n\nThe carbon cronies have made climate change a defining feature of that conversation. Flipping the narrative, they portray climate change advocacy as a sinister effort to establish world government and rob America of its economic independence and sovereignty.\n\nSubscribe to The Defender - It\u2019s Free!

I have litigated these issues across the Americas.\n\nAs a partner of the clean tech investment firm, Vantage Point Venture Partners, and advisor to Stanwool Energy, I was involved in building transmission lines and generation infrastructure for clean, democratic energy from wind and solar, including the two largest solar plants in North America.\n\nI\u2019ve been deeply involved in building and deploying renewable energy infrastructure that competes with oil and coal. Vantage Point was the earliest investor in Tesla and the force behind Ivanpah, the world\u2019s largest solar thermal plant. I know the science and the economics of carbon energy backwards and forwards.\n\nPredatory industries always employ the same playbook. Big Tobacco swore smoking didn\u2019t cause cancer. Monsanto convinced us that DDT and glyphosate were harmless. Pharma lied to persuade doctors and the public that opioids were not addictive, that Vioxx did not cause heart attacks, that vaccines are undeniably safety tested and that the autism epidemic is an illusion. They use the same phony (tobacco) scientists and mercenary biostitutes to gin up fraudulent studies that sow doubt, paralyze policy reform and give political cover to their tame politicians.\n\nThey all work together in lockstep, coordinated by their Capitol Hill trade associations, lobbying firms, captive agencies and paid-off politicians to increase authoritarian control, to transform all of us into mindless consumers, to shift middle-class wealth to billionaire plutocrats and to liquidate our \u201cpurple mountain majesties\u201d and our entire planet.\n\nThey enrich themselves by impoverishing the rest of us. They capture regulators, seduce reporters, corrupt science and pay off lawmakers to subvert democracy. They employ state-of-the-art propaganda, psychological warfare and all the formulaic alchemies of demagoguery to divide us.\n\nFor 40 years, I\u2019ve worked with the Left on conservation, climate, energy and the environment. In recent years, in my battles against Pharma, I have also worked with many right-wing allies, including Trump supporters.\n\nBig Oil, King Coal and Big Pharma are all titans of the Deep State cartel of deception and authoritarian control. In its most audaciously ruthless betrayal, this cartel has engineered a suicide pact for humanity and our planet. They have brought us to the eve of Armageddon. Their business plan poses an existential threat to humanity.\n\nThey have declared war on democracy and personal freedom. They are the Four Horsemen \u2014 the apocalyptic forces of ignorance and greed, pestilence and fear.\n\nToday we are living in the beleaguered world that the Deep State\u2019s greed and negligence has created \u2013\u2013 the science-fiction nightmare that these criminals devised. The glaciers are melting on every continent, threatening the food and water supplies for billions of people. The ice caps are shrinking, their melt water swelling the oceans and flooding coastal cities. Fisheries are collapsing globally.\n\nDisease, drought, fire, famine and flood are transforming the planet into scenes reminiscent of Biblical accounts of the Apocalypse.\n\nThis is not a hoax. You don\u2019t need a science degree to know the planet is warming any more than you need a degree to know that the nation\u2019s autism epidemic is real. In both cases, you need to be deliberately blind to ignore the evidence.\n\nWithin the short time span since the first edition of this book (then titled \u201cHorsemen of the Apocalypse\u201d) appeared in 2017, the pace of climate change has accelerated beyond what anyone had then foreseen. July 2019 became Earth\u2019s hottest month since record-keeping began in 1880.\n\nI live on the West Coast now, where the fire seasons in California are two months longer than they historically have been. Twice in the past two years, my family has had to evacuate our home, in an area that was never part of the traditional fire zone.\n\nMy family has a summer home on Cape Cod. Two 100-year storms struck our town over the past two years, destroying a pier that had withstood every storm for a century.\n\nThese are my personal harbingers of the predictable fallout of climate change: storms on steroids, droughts, famine, disappearance of the ice caps and the glaciers on every continent, spread of insect-borne tropical diseases, threatening civilization and humanity.\n\nWildfires raged across Alaska, the Arctic, Greenland and Siberia; Australian wildfires devastated that continent; California wildfires are 500% larger than they were in the 1970s; the burning of the Amazon is leading to a cascading collapse of natural systems across the planet. In the world\u2019s second-largest rainforest, the Congo, 50%more fires burned than in the Amazon.\n\nThe Canadian Arctic permafrost is thawing 70 years sooner than had been predicted, and a United Nations report warns that at least 30% of the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s permafrost will melt during our children\u2019s lifetime, creating feedback loops that will release billions of tons of methane, the worst of the greenhouse gases.\n\nDuring 2019, sea ice within 150 miles of Alaska\u2019s shoreline completely melted away for the first time in recorded history. The state\u2019s largest city, Anchorage, baked in temperatures of 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Salmon died of heat stress, and levels of shellfish poisoning soared. Then, the Greenland ice sheet lost a mind-bending 12.5 billion tons of water in a single day. That ice sheet contained enough frozen water to raise sea levels around the world by 20 feet.\n\nHundred-year flooding events are now a regular occurrence in the U.S., especially in the Northeast and Southeast. Superstorms and rising sea levels will displace as many as 280 million people around the world. A U.S .report warns that 21 beach towns \u2014 including Miami Beach, Galveston, Atlantic City and Key West \u2014 will soon be underwater.\n\nIndonesia is already relocating the millions who live in its capital city of Jakarta. When I visit our Great Lakes Waterkeepers, I see steadily rising water levels that have put the Great Lakes communities in crisis. Both Detroit and Miami mayors have declared states of emergency as rising waters threaten their cities.\n\nEven as floods are drowning our great municipalities, meteorologists are predicting megadroughts on a scale last witnessed in medieval times. During a 2019 heat wave that swept across Europe, 1,500 people died from heat stroke in France alone. Desert heat will parch the U.S. Southwest within decades.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that two billion people are already facing moderate to severe food insecurity, primarily due to the warming planet. Warmer oceans and a hotter, wetter atmosphere provide steroids to storms. I visited with Bahamas Waterkeepers before and after Hurricane Dorian, which, in 2019, wiped out thousands of housing compounds and businesses on Grand Bahamas. Many of these had taken Bahamian families three generations or more to create.\n\nSubscribe to The Defender - It\u2019s Free!

Ok[jokull] is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier. In the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.\u201d\n\nNowadays, every week seems like a new chapter from the Doomsday Book of Revelation, but I will close with a warning penned by a desert prophet a thousand years earlier:\n\nThe earth lies defiled\n\nunder its inhabitants;\n\nfor they have polluted the land, transgressed the laws,\n\nviolated the statutes,\n\nbroken the everlasting covenant.\n\nTherefore a curse devours the earth,\n\nand its inhabitants suffer for their guilt;\n\ntherefore the inhabitants of the earth are scorched,\n\nand few men are left \u2026\n\n\u2014 Isaiah 24:5-6\n\nIf we are to avoid the curse, we need to call out the authors of the sinful pollution. As the late activist musician Utah Phillips observed more than a decade ago:\n\n\u201cThe earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses.\u201d\n\nThe Deep State profits from our division and employs so-called \u201cbourbon strategy\u201d techniques to keep Americans in internecine struggles \u2014 black against white, urban vs. rural, Christian against Muslim, right against left, blue collar vs. white collar, Republican against Democrat \u2014 to distract us all from waging class war against the Deep State Elites.\n\nThe term should, instead, unite us.\n\nIt\u2019s time to find our common ground and fight the real Deep State, and not each other. We need to work together to escape the seduction of their lies and propaganda so we can unite against the real villains!",

         "content":"Though Tanisha remained terrified of Patrick, she was also liberated. \u201cI started having joy in my life,\u201d she told me. She thought Snyder and Speary would protect her, and that a prosecutor would recognize her courage and commitment to justice.\n\n\u201cWhy did you think that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cBecause this is America.\u2026 I thought if I was just honest, the truth was going to set me free based off American values.\u201d\n\nSpeary interviewed witnesses widely and collected evidence. Then, on June 22, 2009, Patrick called 911 to report that his girlfriend, a 44-year-old nurse named Debra Kukla, was unconscious in the garage. When police arrived, they found Kukla bludgeoned to death.\n\nTanisha told me that Speary had called her days before Kukla\u2019s death; on the call, Speary asked for Tanisha\u2019s permission to tell Patrick that she had been speaking with police. Petrified, Tanisha refused. She theorized that police had nonetheless confronted Patrick, and that \u201che thought [Kukla] was the one who talked.\u201d Tanisha turned 27 the day Kukla died. She recalled that Speary called her that morning \u201cin a panic,\u201d saying, \u201che did it again,\u201d and advising her to find a safe place, because police didn\u2019t know where Patrick was. (According to Tanisha, no one working for the state offered to provide her with security.) \u201cI feel if I had never entered the agreement, Deb would be alive,\u201d Tanisha told me. \u201cEvery year at my birthday I think about her, and I think that I survived.\u201d Speary, now retired, didn\u2019t respond to requests for an interview.\n\nTanisha also believed that her incarceration was related to the fact that Kukla was white. \u201cThey were like, \u2018We have to get him off the streets by any means,\u2019\u201d she told me. \u201cI believe they conjured up they moves, and I was the casualty.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office could not provide me with the exact date it took the case. But the office\u2019s press secretary said it was approximately September 2009\u2014nearly seven years after Kevin\u2019s killing, but only months after Kukla\u2019s. On September 11, 2009, Patrick was arrested by an off-duty police officer who said he had witnessed him robbing a 7-Eleven. In March 2010, Tanisha was arrested at her job at a golf course. She was charged with first-degree murder and booked into Saginaw County Jail. Hon\u2019Esty, then four years old, went to stay with relatives. \u201cShe just was always looking for me [after that],\u201d Tanisha told me. \u201cShe would sit at her desk at school writing me letters.\u201d\n\nThe court appointed William White, a private attorney with a county contract, as Tanisha\u2019s defender. According to a letter that White later wrote to the judge, he was constrained by a \u201c$1,000 cap\u201d on his legal work for Tanisha. He billed for 36.5 hours, which means that, unless he was granted a fee extension, he was paid $27.40 per hour\u2014a rate that diminished the more he worked. A homicide case, according to Moran, of the Michigan Innocence Clinic, \u201cis the legal equivalent of performing brain surgery. It\u2019s complex and requires a great deal of skill to be able to do it right.\u201d\n\nA 2008 National Legal Aid & Defender Association report on Michigan\u2019s indigent defense systems studied sample counties and found that none of their public defender services were constitutionally adequate. The fixed-rate system, which also exists across the United States, created \u201ca conflict of interests between a lawyer\u2019s ethical duty to competently defend each and every client and her financial self-interests that require her to invest the least amount of time possible in each case to maximize profit,\u201d according to the report.\n\nSince 2011, legislative efforts have led to indigent defense reform in Michigan, and in 2019 Saginaw opened its first public defender\u2019s office. Steve Fenner, a former prosecutor who heads the new office, told me that $1,000 to work a homicide was \u201cinsane,\u201d and that the previous system meant that attorneys \u201cbasically lost money\u201d on major cases. But Fenner didn\u2019t understand why Tanisha needed an attorney at all. \u201cWhy was she charged though? I don\u2019t get it. That part is real baffling. She cooperated to solve a cold case, then the attorney general\u2019s office turns on her? I\u2019m virtually speechless.\u201d\n\nTanisha had little interaction with White, her attorney. One day, White brought Sanders, Tanisha\u2019s former stepmother, to a courthouse meeting. Sanders told me that she had arrived for what she believed was a hearing and was surprised to be taken aside by White, who asked that she convince Tanisha to testify at Patrick and Terrance\u2019s trial.\n\nDeputies brought Tanisha, in an orange jumpsuit, into the room. Sanders started to cry. \u201cI say, \u2018This has been going on for a long time, and it need to come to an end \u2026 release all of us from all of this ... whatever it is that they seeking, you need to give it to them.\u201d Sanders had no experience with the legal system and was caring for one of Tanisha\u2019s daughters. She told me that she believed she was helping Tanisha and knew nothing about a plea deal. \u201cI thought they was gonna let her come home \u2026 because she had gave them what they wanted.\u201d\n\nTanisha, after two hours of Sanders\u2019s exhortations and nine months in jail, agreed to testify in exchange for a second-degree murder plea that she originally believed was 20 years flat, not 20 to 40 years. \u201cI took the plea \u2019cause I was sick of being in there, hearing my momma beg me,\u201d she told me. White did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn January 2011, Tanisha testified for the prosecution. For the attorney general\u2019s purposes, Tanisha needed to inhabit contradictory roles: moral and credible enough for a jury to trust, but blameworthy and sufficiently deplorable to exist as an extension of the man who killed Kevin and to therefore merit her own conviction. Doug Baker, the prosecutor, characterized Tanisha and the others as \u201cjackals.\u201d\n\nBaker questioned Tanisha as a key witness over two days, using her testimony as a basis for a larger narrative. Then in his closing arguments, Baker alternately diminished and commended Tanisha. He told the jury that when Tanisha met Patrick, at 20, she was living \u201ca wasted life \u2026 she is prostituting herself. She has children that she\u2019s not living with.\u201d Tanisha was \u201cnot a very reflective or thoughtful person.\u201d But she \u201chad some conscience\u201d and had come forward. Tanisha had acted under duress, he said, but \u201cthat\u2019s not a defense to homicide.\u2026 The law says, no, you can\u2019t do that. You\u2019ve got to resist. You\u2019ve got to\u2014you\u2019ve got to take your chances.\u201d\n\nIn Michigan and many other states, the reason duress cannot be used as a defense for homicide is based on British common law, as summarized by Matthew Hale, a Puritan jurist, who wrote in an influential treatise in the 1600s that even \u201cif a man be desperately assaulted, and in peril of death \u2026 he ought rather to die himself, than kill an innocent.\u201d Hale also put forth other enduring writings and decisions. In one, he sentenced women to death for sorcery, one precedent used to justify the Salem witch trials. In another, Hale stated that by signing a marriage contract, \u201ca wife hath given herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.\u201d A marital exception to rape law, based largely on Hales\u2019s work, existed in England and Wales until 1991 and in North Carolina until 1993. The criminal legal system still treats spousal rape with leniency.\n\n\u201c[Tanisha\u2019s] choice was she should die,\u201d Jacobsen, of the Michigan Women\u2019s Justice & Clemency Project, told me. \u201cOr prison. That\u2019s it. It doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s going to kill you.... You let that happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey got me in here and really don\u2019t know what that man did to me that night,\u201d Tanisha said.\n\n\u201cBlack women can be disposed as an object of punishment in order to demonstrate that the system works,\u201d Alisa Bierria, an assistant professor of African American studies at the University of California, Riverside, and a co-founder of Survived & Punished, an organization that supports incarcerated survivors of gender-based violence, told me. \u201cThis is what the system does, that\u2019s what it is: It has to perform justice in order to have good copy, but it performs that on the backs of Black women all the time because nobody is interested in the full dimensionality of their story as a human being.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurviving all of that shit, I can\u2019t even believe this is my life for real,\u201d Tanisha told me. \u201cI really be like, \u2018God, what\u2019s up? What is all of this about?\u2019 I love taking care of the earth, I love kids... I got so much suffering and I never did nothing.\u201d The authorities, she said, \u201cdidn\u2019t and don\u2019t care what happened to me. No one don\u2019t even know how I lived.\u2026 They got me in here and really don\u2019t know what that man did to me that night.\u201d\n\nIn October, Patrick Martin called me from Kinross Correctional Facility in northern Michigan, where he is serving life for armed robbery and two murders. (He pleaded no contest to killing Debra Kukla after a jury convicted him of killing Kevin Amos.) Patrick said that he had bipolar disorder with psychotic features, was \u201ca full-blown alcoholic,\u201d and had been institutionalized in 2007 and 2008. He described years of \u201cmadness,\u201d and told me that his 2009 arrest was \u201calmost a relief.\u201d Patrick could not express why his mental illness and alcoholism manifested in lethal violence, including toward women, but he could speak clearly to why Tanisha and his cousin Terrance had participated in Kevin Amos\u2019s murder. \u201cI made them do that,\u201d he said.\n\nWould he have killed Tanisha, I asked, if she hadn\u2019t obeyed?\n\n\u201cI always had them guns and stuff.\u2026 My own mom would be scared. At that time, [Tanisha] was terrified.... I told them, \u2018If you don\u2019t do it, I\u2019ma do you.\u2019 So they did it, but it was out of fear. They wasn\u2019t with the plan.\u201d\n\nEight days later, I called Doug Baker, the prosecutor in Tanisha\u2019s case, now chief of criminal enforcement and quality of life for the city of Detroit. We spoke at length about his reasons for charging and sentencing Tanisha to decades in prison, considering the role she played in the actual crime and in helping authorities.\n\nBaker explained that when a witness has accepted a lengthy sentence, it can benefit the prosecutor who puts her on the stand. \u201cPart of what goes into making a witness like [Tanisha] credible is that she\u2019s paying for what she did,\u201d Baker said. \u201cAnd the jury hears that. If a jury takes somebody that gets \u2026 probation or whatever, that\u2019s argued to the hilt by the other side that they would say and do anything to get this sentence.\u201d This suggests that a prosecutor, who has nearly total discretion in charging decisions, may be incentivized to seek the most serious charges that ultimately carry extensive sentences.\n\nBaker also argued that Tanisha\u2019s sentence was a form of justice for Kevin and his family. Tanisha, he said, was \u201cthe one that actually in that sense literally took the life. She made sure that he wasn\u2019t going to get those last breaths.\u201d\n\nAt the 2011 trial, the medical examiner testified that Kevin died of asphyxiation, because there was duct tape on his mouth and liquid in his lungs. He also testified that two quarters were found in Kevin\u2019s stomach and a bag of powder was found in his mouth, and that a dead person cannot swallow\u2014so Kevin was alive when the quarters were put into his mouth.\n\nSince her first interview with Speary in 2009, Tanisha has denied any knowledge of the bag or coins. At trial, a confidential informant for the state, a drug dealer, testified that he briefly stopped by the apartment on the night of the attack and saw Kevin bound on the floor. Within days, he helped dispose of Kevin\u2019s body. In August 2003, eight months after the murder, the informant was in jail, looking to cut a deal to get out two months early. He told authorities about Kevin\u2019s killing, and in order to prove that he was reliable, offered a detail that \u201cnobody else would know except for somebody that had firsthand information,\u201d he testified. The detail was that Patrick \u201csaid that he put 50 cents in [Kevin\u2019s] mouth to make it look like a drug transaction.\u201d\n\nWhen I spoke with Patrick, he didn\u2019t recall anything about the coins. Still, it seemed possible that Patrick may have removed and replaced the tape over Kevin\u2019s mouth, the final act that killed him. (Terrance Shepard, serving a life sentence in a southern Michigan prison, declined to comment for this story.)\n\nAt trial, Baker told the jury: \u201cIt\u2019s 20 to 40 years out of her life. She\u2014at least 20. It could be more.\u201d On the phone, after we had discussed Tanisha\u2019s story, Baker said, \u201cI think that she would be a good subject for being paroled.\u201d\n\nAt Tanisha\u2019s March 2011 sentencing, Baker provided her with a letter on attorney general\u2019s office letterhead. He wrote that she had participated in the homicide \u201cafter being threatened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can attest to Ms. Williams\u2019 complete cooperation, candid testimony and remorse for her role in the crime,\u201d Baker wrote. \u201cThere is no question that Ms. Williams, as a Prosecution witness, was of invaluable assistance in bringing the other Defendants to justice.\u2026 We believe that Ms. Williams can be rehabilitated and someday live a law-abiding life.\u201d\n\nHowever, just before her arrest in 2010, Tanisha was stable and productive. She was sober, raising her daughter, and working three conventional jobs. \u201cI was a proud, tax-paying citizen,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was on a positive path.\u201d\n\nI read Baker his 2011 letter. I asked him what Tanisha\u2019s lengthy sentence was supposed to accomplish.\n\n\u201cIt has a deterrent value, as well as a punishment value, as well as a rehabilitative value,\u201d he said.\n\nBut neither Tanisha\u2019s nor Patrick\u2019s incarceration seemed to produce any constructive change in their closest circles. The cycle of gender-based violence and mental illness has continued. Patrick\u2019s son, Patrick Allen Martin Jr., was 11 when Kevin was killed. As a young man, he was sent to prison. \u201cHe was different when he came home,\u201d his sister would later testify. He lived in a facility for people with mental health issues.\n\nIn 2019, Patrick Jr., then 27, shot MoeNeisha Simmons-Ross, Tanisha\u2019s 26-year-old niece and a mother of three who was also pregnant with Patrick Jr.\u2019s child. MoeNeisha and the baby died. Her brother told local media that MoeNeisha\u2019s other children \u201cwere in the apartment and they saw what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe system is a freaking violence-producing factory,\u201d Bierria, the Survived & Punished co-founder, told me. \u201cRelentless.\u201d\n\nA theme emerged in my research: As in Tanisha\u2019s case, incarcerated women, before their involvement in the legal system, were regularly disregarded or damaged by state systems, from Child Protective Services to schools to police. Families and individuals in desperate situations did not have access to quality services, or to sustained services\u2014and were often scared of seeking outside help. \u201cIn the Black community you don\u2019t go to the cops,\u201d Tanisha told me. \u201cYou just solve your own shit. And then with a crime, the code is you never talk, don\u2019t ever talk, and I see why.\u201d\n\nSandra Brown, a Black woman in Illinois, wrote of years of terror, beginning in childhood. She was beaten, spit on, and bullied at school. When she fought back, she was expelled, labeled \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d At home, she was whipped. After she explained why she had welts on her legs to a trusted teacher, she says she \u201cpaid terribly for it.\u201d Sandra was later a victim of domestic violence and rape. As a young mother, she was arrested for killing a woman in what she says was an act of self-defense. She was sentenced to 22 years in prison. \u201cThe tragedies we suffered as little girls and young women in a sense \u2018groomed and doomed\u2019 us to this current state of modernized slavery,\u201d Sandra wrote me. \u201cI have been the recipient of acts of violence since I was a child, and the law was virtually nowhere to be found. But the one time I fight back because I am afraid for my life, I am now a \u2018violent\u2019 offender.\u201d\n\nBierria observed that stories of gender-based criminalization were the result of the legal system\u2019s design and function. \u201cIt\u2019s not, \u2018Oh what a sad story, the prosecutor didn\u2019t care, the defense was bad,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThose things animate the system we have.\u2026 What you see are formalized acts of profound, life-ending violence.\u201d\n\nWhat was the alternative, particularly for women?\n\n\u201cWe have to build it,\u201d Bierria said. Across the country, she said, people have long been engaging in concentrated, community-based anti-violence and transformative justice work, training, and education. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic answer that will get us where we need to go. All we have is us.\u2026 I think people are on it, and therefore I think there is a chance.\u201d\n\nThe respondents to my survey offered various solutions, including childhood intervention, decriminalizing poverty, treating mental illness and addiction, effective protection for sexual and domestic violence victims, changing incentives for police and prosecutors, engaging offenders and victims in restorative justice processes, and capping sentence lengths. One woman suggested that people be permitted to tour prisons and jails: \u201cAllow the public to see who is in their prisons.\u201d\n\nTanisha, for her part, wanted to be seen\u2014as a way to advocate for herself and others. I asked her why she responded to my letter in the first place. \u201cI know everything I\u2019ve been through,\u201d she said. \u201cThis matters for women.\u2026 I felt that every little bit helps.\u201d\n\nTanisha understood that at each turn she had been failed: as an abused child, homeless teenager, traumatized young mother, and perhaps most significantly by a state apparatus that reduced and exploited her story and good-faith efforts to bring closure to Kevin and his family. But she remained hopeful. She never complained about the abysmal conditions at Huron Valley, with its endemic black mold, repeated scabies outbreaks, and waves of Covid. She meditates, does yoga in the mornings, pores over legal papers, and works disinfecting the facility at night.\n\nI asked Tanisha how she remained so persistently optimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s some favor,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething in my spirit that sustains me.\u201d She thought of her efforts to shine a light on injustice in biblical terms: as a mustard seed. In Scripture, the mustard seed is the smallest of seeds, but, when sown, becomes a tree, its branches filled with birds. \u201cAs long as we got a mustard seed, we can make it grow.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with The Appeal, and was supported by the Pulitzer Center.",
